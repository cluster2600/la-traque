## Story Synopsis

Thomas Dieudegard, 40, is a former French Navy captain (Capitaine de Corvette) and combat swimmer who now works for French intelligence (DGSE). He lives alone in a minimal apartment on Rue des Rosiers in the Marais district of Paris.

On a February morning in 2018, three bombs are placed in Métro Line 14 between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare stations. Two detonate. The middle car goes dark with 43+ civilians trapped inside. Thomas coordinates the rescue operation.

But the bombing triggers a buried trauma: 23 years earlier, in July 1995 (25 July), Thomas's best friend Jérôme died in the Saint-Michel RER B bombing when Thomas was 16. Thomas was at the summer meeting with their friend group. Jérôme was late and missed it. He decided to take the RER B train to join them later. He took the train with the bomb. He was sitting on a strapontin (fold-down seat) directly above the bomb. It took two days to identify his body (dental records). Thomas survived by simply being at the right place at the right time. Jérôme died for being late.

Now, as Thomas rescues strangers from darkness, he's also hunting the terrorist cell responsible. His investigation leads him to Yasmin Aliyev, a Chechen-Russian cell leader, and three other conspirators. What starts as a professional duty becomes a personal obsession — a second chance to save lives, to prevent the next thirty-minute delay from killing another Jérôme.

The novel explores whether justice and revenge are the same thing. Whether saving some people balances the cost of what you become to save them.

## Character Profile: Thomas Dieudegard

**Personal Details**
- **Born:** December 28, 1978 (40 years old in 2018)
- **Birthplace:** Normandy, France
- **Religion:** Protestant
- **Heritage:** Huguenot (maternal line)
- **Current Residence:** Rue des Rosiers, Paris (Le Marais)

**Family Background**
- **Mother:** Protestant, Huguenot descent. Her family were wine producers in Rhodesia. Lost everything when the colony ended and Zimbabwe became independent (circa 1980).
- **Father:** Protestant. Diplomat/security background. Distant but protective.
- **Siblings:** 
  - Victoire (35 years old, born ~1983)
  - Louis (33 years old, born ~1985)
- **Role in family:** Eldest brother. Responsible. Protector.

**Military Background**
- **Training:** École de la Marine Nationale Maistrance (French Navy Officer School)
- **Rank:** Capitaine de Corvette (Navy Captain)
- **Specialization:** Nageur de Combat (Combat Swimmer)
- **Service Period:** ~1998-2010 (estimate)
- **Transition:** Left Navy for DGSE (French Intelligence Service)

**Current Life (2018)**
- **Job:** DGSE field coordinator / special operations
- **Apartment:** Small, minimal, 1 bedroom (built 1847)
- **Morning Routine:** Wakes at 5:47 AM (before alarm). La Marzocco espresso machine (auto-heat). Espresso only, no sugar/milk.
- **Lifestyle:** Disciplined. Precise. Routine-driven. Everything minimal and necessary.

**The Formative Trauma**
- **Best Friend:** Jérôme (no last name given in outline)
- **Date of Death:** July 25, 1995 (Saint-Michel RER B bombing)
- **Thomas's Age:** 16 years old
- **The Meeting:** Summer group of friends met at a café (colony de vacances reunion). Thomas was there. Jérôme was LATE.
- **Jérôme's Choice:** Jérôme called Thomas's parents' apartment. He apologized for being late. Asked to reschedule at a different location (Saint-Michel Métro, closer to home). Thomas said okay.
- **The Bomb:** Jérôme took the RER B train to Saint-Michel. He was on a strapontin (fold-down seat) directly above the bomb. The bomb detonated. He was one of 8 dead.
- **The Randomness:** Thomas survived by being at the café. He didn't catch the train. Jérôme died because he was late to the first meeting and tried to catch up by taking that specific train at that specific time. Pure chance. Placement on the strapontin was pure chance.
- **Body Identification:** Took 2 days (dental records required, bomb damage was extensive).
- **Psychological Impact:** Drives entire adult life. Obsession with prevention, order, control. Discipline as a weapon against randomness. Determination to save lives, to prevent the next Jérôme from dying to chance. Not guilt about being late, but awareness that TIMING decides everything. Being 5 minutes early or late decides life or death. Thomas became obsessed with control, with seeing threats before they happen, with preventing randomness from taking anyone else.

**Personality**
- Quiet, observant, controlled
- No room for error in his thinking
- Haunted by the mathematics of chance
- Professional, competent, ruthless when necessary
- Increasingly obsessive about Jérôme's death as the novel progresses

## Writing Style: Lee Child (Jack Reacher)

**Core Principles:**
- **Short sentences.** Declarative. Direct.
- **Present tense in action scenes.** Immediacy.
- **Minimal internal monologue.** Show don't tell.
- **Sparse description.** No flowery prose. Just what matters.
- **Maximum tension.** Every paragraph moves the plot.
- **Moral ambiguity.** No easy answers. Gray on gray.
- **Dialogue reveals character.** Not exposition.
- **Action-first narrative.** The plot is the character.

**Example sentence structure:**
- "The alarm doesn't wake him." (Short, establishes character)
- "He gets out of bed. Cold floor." (Action + sensory detail)
- "Thirty to fifty. The numbers hang in the air like smoke." (Minimalist, visceral)

---

## Themes

- **Revenge vs. Justice:** Are they the same? Can you have one without becoming the other?
- **Order Built on Violence:** Thomas brings order through force. Yasmin seeks justice through destruction. Who is right?
- **The Cost of Obsession:** What does it cost to spend 23 years hunting a ghost?
- **Cycles That Never End:** Save 43 people. Jérôme is still dead. Another cell rises. The cycle continues.
- **The Thirty Minutes:** How much of our lives is chance? How much can we control?
