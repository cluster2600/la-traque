## Story Premise

**The Bombing:**
On a February morning in 2018, terrorists strike Métro Line 14 in Paris — a sophisticated, coordinated attack designed to kill not just civilians but the emergency responders trying to save them.

**The Ambulance:** At 6:20 AM, a van rigged with 2 tonnes of homemade nitroglycerine detonates at Saint-Lazare's Cour de Rome dome. Emergency crews converge. A second detonation catches the responders in the blast. Multiple rescue workers die. Emergency response capability is crippled.

**The Métro:** Simultaneously, three wheelchair-mounted bombs are deployed in the open interior of Métro Line 14. Two detonate. One fails. The darkness swallows everyone inside.

**The Hunter:** Thomas Dieudegard, 40, a former Navy combat swimmer now working intelligence for DGSE, arrives to assess the carnage. He doesn't rescue anyone. He observes. He calculates. He hunts.

The novel follows Thomas's investigation into the cell responsible. It is not a hero story. It is a vengeance story.

## Themes

- **Vengeance vs. Justice:** Are they the same? What does it cost?
- **Order Built on Violence:** Thomas brings order through force. Yasmin seeks justice through destruction. Who is right?
- **Mirrors:** Thomas and Yasmin are reflections of each other. Both justified, both ruthless.
- **Cycles That Never End:** Justice doesn't bring closure. Another cell will rise. The hunt continues.
- **The Detective:** Not a hero. Not a savior. A hunter.

## Writing Style: Lee Child (Jack Reacher)

**Core Principles:**
- **Short sentences.** Declarative. Direct.
- **Present tense in action.** Immediacy.
- **Minimal internal monologue.** Show don't tell.
- **Sparse description.** Only what matters.
- **Maximum tension.** Every paragraph moves plot.
- **Moral ambiguity.** Gray on gray. No easy answers.
- **Dialogue reveals character.** Not exposition.
- **Action-first narrative.** The plot is the character.
