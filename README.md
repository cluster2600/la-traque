## Story Synopsis

Thomas Dieudegard, 40, is a former French Navy captain (Capitaine de Corvette) and combat swimmer who now works for French intelligence (DGSE). He lives alone in a minimal apartment on Rue des Rosiers in the Marais district of Paris.

On a February morning in 2018, three bombs are placed in Métro Line 14 between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare stations. Two detonate. The line goes dark with 43+ civilians trapped inside the open car. Thomas does not save them.

But the bombing triggers a buried trauma: 23 years earlier, in July 1995 (25 July), Thomas's holiday friend Jérôme died in the Saint-Michel RER B bombing when Thomas was 16. Thomas was at the summer meeting with their friend group. Jérôme was late and missed it. He decided to take the RER B train to join them later. He took the train with the bomb. He was sitting on a strapontin (fold-down seat) directly above the bomb. It took two days to identify his body (dental records). Thomas survived by simply being at the right place at the right time. Jérôme died for being late.

Now, Thomas is not rescuing anyone — he's hunting the terrorist cell responsible. His investigation leads him to Yasmin Aliyev, a Chechen-Russian cell leader, and three other conspirators. What starts as a professional duty becomes a personal obsession — a hunt for justice, perhaps, or perhaps just revenge.

The novel explores whether justice and revenge are the same thing. Whether hunting the ones who took 43 lives balances the cost of what you become in the process.

## 🔴 NEW PLOT ELEMENTS (Locked Feb 15, 2026)

**CRITICAL STORY ADDITIONS — INTEGRATED INTO CHAPTERS 2, 6, & 11:**

### Ambulance Explosion at Saint-Lazare (Chapter 2)
- **Location:** Cour de Rome dome above Saint-Lazare Métro station
- **Timing:** ~6:20 AM (few minutes BEFORE Thomas arrives at ~6:45 AM following 6:25 AM call)
- **Payload:** 2 tonnes of homemade nitroglycerine (realistic vehicle weight capacity)
- **Purpose:** KILL RESCUE WORKERS — creates secondary casualties during emergency response operations
  - Emergency personnel converge on ambulance scene
  - Second detonation catches responders in the blast radius
  - Decimates rescue teams, reduces capacity for Métro 14 evacuation
  - Forces Thomas to choose: assist wounded responders OR prioritize Métro 14 survivors
- **Impact:** 
  - Multiple rescue workers killed/wounded (secondary mass casualty event)
  - Emergency response capability severely degraded at critical moment
  - Psychological terror — the cell targets those trying to save lives
  - Demonstrates cell's strategic thinking: disable rescue capacity BEFORE main operation
- **Narrative Function:** Establishes the cell as highly organized, calculating, and ruthless; Thomas's assessment informs his entire investigation; he knows he's hunting professionals who think 3 moves ahead

### Three Wheelchair Bombs in Métro Line 14 (Chapters 6, 6.5, & 11)
- **Total Count:** 3 explosive-rigged wheelchairs (not 2 as initially outlined)
- **Deployment Timeline:**
  - 2 wheelchairs positioned early (occupy car space, blend with morning commute)
  - 1 wheelchair positioned just before detonation window
- **Detonation Status:**
  - ✅ **Wheelchair #1 & #2:** Both EXPLODE successfully (highest casualties, multiple cars affected)
  - ❌ **Wheelchair #3:** FAILS TO DETONATE (operated by Abdelkrim, becomes forensic breakthrough)
- **Story Impact:** Failed device becomes key to cracking the entire cell network

### Abdelkrim Belkacem — The Failed Operator (Chapters 6.5 & 11)
- **Name:** Abdelkrim Belkacem
- **Age:** 19 years old
- **Physical Status:** Paralyzed from waist down (confinement to wheelchair)
- **Origin:** Mantes-la-Jolie (French suburb, high unemployment, marginalized community)
- **Recruitment:** Hassan Mehran personally recruited him at ~18 years old (sympathetic to cell ideology, youth vulnerability)
- **Backstory:** Paralyzed in 2021 police chase gone wrong (police brutality, no accountability)
- **Motivation:** Hatred of French police system; sees terrorism as retribution for marginalization and personal trauma
- **Role in Bombing:** Operates the third wheelchair bomb in Métro 14
- **The Failure:** His device DOES NOT DETONATE at age 19 (mechanical failure or psychological hesitation unclear)
- **Aftermath:** Remains at scene in disabled wheelchair, arrested immediately
- **Forensic Breakthrough:** Failed device + Abdelkrim's testimony + wheelchair forensics crack entire cell structure
- **Narrative Function:** Youth + disability + marginalization = recruitment pipeline; shows how vulnerable young people are weaponized; his age and hesitation humanize the cell; provides the plot mechanism for Thomas's investigation success

### Revised Timeline & Scale
- **Bombing Complexity:** Not a simple 3-bomb operation — sophisticated distraction (ambulance) + coordinated timing
- **Casualty Pattern:** Heavy losses across the open car (from successful wheelchairs); 43 civilians die in the darkness of Métro 14
- **Investigation Pivot:** Failed device + Abdelkrim's identity → Hassan Mehran's recruitment network → Full cell exposure
- **Thomas's Victory:** Not through superior tactics, but because human weakness (Abdelkrim's doubts) cracked the machine

## Character Profile: Thomas Dieudegard

**Personal Details**
- **Born:** December 28, 1978 (40 years old in 2018)
- **Birthplace:** Normandy, France
- **Religion:** Protestant
- **Heritage:** Huguenot (maternal line)
- **Current Residence:** 14 Rue des Rosiers, 2ème étage, Paris (Le Marais, 4th arrondissement)

**Family Background**
- **Mother:** Protestant, Huguenot descent. Her family were wine producers in Rhodesia. Lost everything when the colony ended and Zimbabwe became independent (circa 1980).
- **Father:** Protestant. Background TBD (not diplomat). Distant but protective.
- **Siblings:** 
  - Victoire (35 years old, born ~1983)
  - Louis (33 years old, born ~1985)
- **Role in family:** Eldest brother. Responsible. Protector.

**Military Background**
- **Training:** École de la Marine Nationale Maistrance (French Navy Officer School)
- **Rank:** Capitaine de Corvette (Navy Captain)
- **Specialization:** Nageur de Combat (Combat Swimmer)
- **Service Period:** ~1998-2010 (estimate)
- **Transition:** Left Navy for DGSE (French Intelligence Service)

**Current Life (2018)**
- **Job:** DGSE field coordinator / special operations
- **Apartment:** Small, minimal, 1 bedroom (built 1847)
- **Morning Routine:** Wakes at 5:47 AM (before alarm). La Marzocco espresso machine (auto-heat). Espresso only, no sugar/milk.
- **Lifestyle:** Disciplined. Precise. Routine-driven. Everything minimal and necessary.

**The Formative Trauma**
- **Holiday Friend:** Jérôme (no last name given in outline)
- **Date of Death:** July 25, 1995 (Saint-Michel RER B bombing)
- **Thomas's Age:** 16 years old
- **The Meeting:** Summer group of friends met at a café (colony de vacances reunion). Thomas was there. Jérôme was LATE.
- **Jérôme's Choice:** Jérôme called Thomas's parents' apartment. He apologized for being late. Asked to reschedule at a different location (Saint-Michel Métro, closer to home). Thomas said okay.
- **The Bomb:** Jérôme took the RER B train to Saint-Michel. He was on a strapontin (fold-down seat) directly above the bomb. The bomb detonated. He was one of 8 dead.
- **The Randomness:** Thomas survived by being at the café. He didn't catch the train. Jérôme died because he was late to the first meeting and tried to catch up by taking that specific train at that specific time. Pure chance. Placement on the strapontin was pure chance.
- **Body Identification:** Took 2 days (dental records required, bomb damage was extensive).
- **Psychological Impact:** Drives entire adult life. Obsession with prevention, order, control. Discipline as a weapon against randomness. Awareness that TIMING decides everything — being 5 minutes early or late decides life or death. Thomas became obsessed with control, with seeing threats before they happen, with preventing randomness from taking anyone else. But he cannot save Jérôme. And he cannot save the 43 civilians in Métro 14.

**Personality**
- Quiet, observant, controlled
- No room for error in his thinking
- Haunted by the mathematics of chance
- Professional, competent, ruthless when necessary
- Increasingly obsessive about Jérôme's death as the novel progresses

## Writing Style: Lee Child (Jack Reacher)

**Core Principles:**
- **Short sentences.** Declarative. Direct.
- **Present tense in action scenes.** Immediacy.
- **Minimal internal monologue.** Show don't tell.
- **Sparse description.** No flowery prose. Just what matters.
- **Maximum tension.** Every paragraph moves the plot.
- **Moral ambiguity.** No easy answers. Gray on gray.
- **Dialogue reveals character.** Not exposition.
- **Action-first narrative.** The plot is the character.

**Example sentence structure:**
- "The alarm doesn't wake him." (Short, establishes character)
- "He gets out of bed. Cold floor." (Action + sensory detail)
- "Thirty to fifty. The numbers hang in the air like smoke." (Minimalist, visceral)

---

## Themes

- **Revenge vs. Justice:** Are they the same? Can you have one without becoming the other?
- **Order Built on Violence:** Thomas brings order through force. Yasmin seeks justice through destruction. Who is right?
- **The Cost of Obsession:** What does it cost to spend 23 years hunting a ghost?
- **Cycles That Never End:** Save 43 people. Jérôme is still dead. Another cell rises. The cycle continues.
- **The Thirty Minutes:** How much of our lives is chance? How much can we control?
