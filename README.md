## Story Premise

**The Attack.**  
On a winter morning, terrorists strike Métro Line 14 in Paris in a coordinated operation that kills 2,391 people across five targets: the metro itself, the Louvre pyramid, the Élysée Palace grounds, the Eiffel Tower base, and a barge at Bercy. It is the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II.

**The Cell.**  
Yasmine Boudjellal, a French-Algerian woman from Mantes-la-Jolie, leads a small, disciplined cell motivated by colonial rage — the unpaid debt of the Algerian War of Independence, the mass killings that France has never acknowledged, the families broken across generations. She is not a religious extremist. She is a woman with a cause and a calculator.

**The Hunter.**  
Thomas Dieudegard, 42, Colonel at the DGSE, receives Presidential-level authorization to hunt the cell across Europe and North Africa and eliminate every member. No arrests. No trials. No publicity. A deniable operation built on plausible denial and unlimited resources.

**The Hunt.**  
Paris → Marseille → Mediterranean → Algiers → Zug (Switzerland) → Palermo (Sicily) → Tunis → Lisbon → back to the Mediterranean → Tadrart (southeastern Sahara). Thomas's six-person team eliminates cell members one by one across seven countries over eight weeks.

**The End.**  
Yasmine sits in a stone house at the edge of the Sahara, in the coordinates documented in a Swiss safe, waiting for a manhunt she believes has faded. It hasn't.

## Themes

- **Colonial debt and its inheritors:** The Algerian War killed hundreds of thousands. France has never officially apologized. What does that silence cost, in what currency, and to whom?
- **Vengeance vs. justice:** Are they distinguishable when the state performs one and a terrorist the other?
- **Alienation without homeland:** Yasmine is too French for Algeria and too bloody for France. She belongs nowhere.
- **The price of moral clarity:** Thomas never doubts his mission. That certainty is its own kind of horror.
- **The Mediterranean as moral geography:** The sea separates the law from its absence, Europe from Africa, hunter from prey — until it doesn't.
