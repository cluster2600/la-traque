# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 21: PALERMO SURVEILLANCE

Beaumont and Tarkovsky arrive in Palermo on a Tuesday.

They fly commercial. Different flights. Different airlines. Different identities. They're tourists. French tourists visiting Sicily. Nobody looks twice.

They meet at a café near the harbor. Outdoor seating. View of the boats. Beaumont orders espresso. Tarkovsky orders nothing. Just sits.

"He's in the old quarter," Beaumont says. "Via Alloro. Third floor apartment. Rented under false name. Payments in cash."

"How did we find him?" Tarkovsky asks.

"His contact. The man who gave him the apartment. DGSE has a file on him. Mafia associate. He's helped smuggle people before. We put pressure on him. He talked."

"Pressure?"

"Money. We paid better than Hassan Jr. could."

Tarkovsky nods. Money always works. Fear works. But money works better.

"What's the surveillance status?" Tarkovsky asks.

"We have eyes on the apartment. Local asset. He's been watching for three days. Hassan Jr. leaves once a day. Buys food. Walks to the harbor. Watches the boats. Returns home. Same pattern. Predictable."

"When does he leave?"

"Afternoon. Around 3:00 PM. Always the same time. Always the same route."

Tarkovsky processes this. Predictability means vulnerability. Routine means opportunity.

"We need to see the apartment," Tarkovsky says.

They walk. Through Palermo's narrow streets. Through the old quarter. Stone buildings. Laundry hanging between windows. Old Sicily. The kind of place where families have lived for generations. Where strangers are noticed.

But tourists come here every day. French tourists. German tourists. American tourists. Beaumont and Tarkovsky blend in. Just two more foreigners admiring architecture.

Via Alloro appears. Narrow street. Buildings pressed together. Hassan Jr.'s apartment is midway down. Third floor. Windows overlooking the street.

Beaumont points subtly.

"There. Third floor. Corner window."

Tarkovsky looks without looking. Professional surveillance. Seeing without being seen.

The windows are dark. Curtains closed. No movement visible.

"He's inside?" Tarkovsky asks.

"Should be. He doesn't leave until afternoon."

They walk past. Don't stop. Don't stare. Just another pair of tourists exploring the city.

Around the corner, Beaumont shows Tarkovsky the building layout on his phone. Floor plans. Entrances. Exits. Roof access.

"How did you get this?" Tarkovsky asks.

"City records. Building permits. Public information. We know the layout. We know his apartment number. We know the best entry points."

"Front door?"

"Locked. Building has six apartments. Residents would notice strangers."

"Roof?"

"Accessible from adjacent building. We can cross rooftops. Enter through his window."

"When?"

"Tomorrow night. He'll be asleep. We enter. We eliminate. We leave. Clean. Quiet. Professional."

Tarkovsky thinks about this. A night operation. A residential building. Close quarters. Silent elimination required.

"Weapons?" Tarkovsky asks.

"Suppressed Glocks. If we're quiet, one shot. If we're not, we improvise."

"What about the neighbors?"

"Old Sicilians. They go to bed early. By midnight, the building is quiet. We wait until 2:00 AM. Maximum darkness. Minimum witnesses."

Tarkovsky nods. He's done this before. Apartment entries. Night operations. Silent kills. This is standard work.

"Show me the roof approach," Tarkovsky says.

They circle the block. Adjacent building. Shorter. Flat roof. Accessible from fire escape.

Beaumont points.

"We climb here. Cross the roof. Jump gap to Hassan Jr.'s building. His window is on the roof side. We enter there. Three-meter jump. Easy. Even in darkness."

Tarkovsky studies the gap. The distance. The angle. He's made harder jumps. This is nothing.

"What's the exit strategy?" Tarkovsky asks.

"Same route. Back across the roof. Down the fire escape. Into the street. Separate. You go north. I go south. Meet at the harbor in one hour. Dispose of weapons in the sea. Leave Palermo by morning."

"Clean?"

"Very clean."

They walk back to the café. They sit. They watch the harbor. They plan the details.

"I'll take the shot," Tarkovsky says. "You watch the door. Anyone comes, we eliminate them too."

"Understood."

"We bring rope?"

"In case we need to restrain someone. Or silence someone. Yes."

"Medical kit?"

"Leclerc won't be with us. If we get injured, we patch ourselves. If we can't patch ourselves, we extract. Hospital means exposure. Exposure means failure."

Tarkovsky accepts this. These are the rules. These are the risks. This is the job.

"What do we know about Hassan Jr.?" Tarkovsky asks.

"Thirty-two years old. Operational planner for the cell. Italian mother. Algerian father. Speaks Italian, French, Arabic. Trained in Libya. Experienced. Not stupid. But predictable."

"Armed?"

"Probably. Assume he sleeps with a weapon. We move fast. We give him no time to react."

Tarkovsky nods. Speed is essential. Surprise is essential. Violence of action is essential.

"Tomorrow night," Tarkovsky confirms.

"Tomorrow night."

They finish their coffee. They leave the café. They separate. Beaumont goes to the hotel. Tarkovsky walks the city. Learning streets. Learning routes. Learning escape paths.

Palermo is old. Palermo is complicated. Palermo is a maze of narrow streets and dead ends. But Tarkovsky is Russian. Tarkovsky trained in Moscow. Tarkovsky knows how to navigate unfamiliar cities.

He walks for two hours. By the time he returns to the hotel, he knows fifteen different routes between the apartment and the harbor. He knows which streets are quiet. Which are busy. Which have cameras. Which don't.

Professional preparation. The difference between success and death.

That night, Tarkovsky cleans his Glock. Checks the suppressor. Tests the action. Loads seventeen rounds. Federal HST. Hollow points. Maximum tissue damage. Minimum over-penetration.

One shot should be enough. But he loads seventeen just in case.

Beaumont does the same in his room. Two operators. Two weapons. One target.

Tomorrow night, Hassan Jr. dies.

The cell is getting smaller. The hunt is accelerating. One by one, Thomas is coming for them all.

In Via Alloro, Hassan Jr. sleeps. He doesn't know two DGSE operators are in Palermo. He doesn't know his contact betrayed him. He doesn't know tomorrow is his last day.

He thinks he's safe. He thinks Sicily protects him. He thinks the Mafia connection means security.

He's wrong.

Tomorrow night, Tarkovsky will cross the rooftops. Beaumont will watch the door. And Hassan Jr. will die in his sleep. A bullet through the head. Professional. Clean. Final.

The hunt continues. The cell shrinks. The inevitable approaches.
