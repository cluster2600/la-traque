# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 24: ZUG WEALTH

Malik Benhadj lives well in Zug.

The apartment is expensive. Lake view. Modern. Clean lines. The kind of place where rich people hide their money and themselves.

He rents it for twelve thousand francs per month. Cash. Six months upfront. The landlord doesn't ask questions. The landlord sees cash and stops caring about background checks.

Malik doesn't leave much. Once a week for groceries. Twice a week for the gym. Every day he walks to the lake. Sits on a bench. Watches the water. Thinks about what he did. Thinks about the money he's accumulating. Thinks about the future.

He's converting cryptocurrency into physical assets. Gold. Diamonds. US Treasury bearer bonds. Watches. Anything valuable and portable. Anything he can carry if he needs to run.

The safe is in his bedroom closet. Professional grade. Five hundred kilograms. Bolt-mounted to concrete. Fireproof. Waterproof. The kind of safe that requires explosives to open.

Inside: everything.

Gold bars. Ten kilograms each. He buys them from Zurich dealers. Cash transactions. No names. No records. He carries them back to Zug on the train. Hidden in a backpack. Heavy. But valuable.

He has twelve bars now. One hundred twenty kilograms of gold. At current prices: approximately five million Swiss francs. Untraceable wealth. Portable. Eternal.

Diamonds. He buys them from Antwerp dealers. Travels there monthly. Cash purchases. Certified stones. Professional cuts. He carries them back in velvet pouches. Hidden in his clothing. Light. Compact. Worth millions.

He has approximately two hundred stones now. Various sizes. Various grades. Total value: approximately ten million Swiss francs. Maybe more. Diamonds are hard to value precisely. But these are investment-grade. These are real.

US Treasury bearer bonds. He buys them through Swiss financial intermediaries. Anonymous purchases. No registration. No names. The bonds are physical certificates. Whoever holds them owns them. Perfect anonymity. Perfect portability.

He has bonds worth thirty million Swiss francs. Maybe more. Face value. Redeemable at any US bank. No questions. No identification required. Just present the bond. Receive the money. Walk away.

Watches. He buys luxury timepieces. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Audemars Piguet. Watches that hold value. Watches that appreciate. Watches worth tens of thousands each.

He has fifteen watches now. Total value: approximately three million Swiss francs. Not as portable as diamonds. Not as stable as gold. But diverse. Hedging his bets.

Cash. He keeps one million Swiss francs in thousand-franc notes. In the safe. Just in case. For emergencies. For immediate liquidity. For running if he needs to run.

Total accumulated wealth: approximately fifty million Swiss francs. Maybe more.

All in the safe. All hidden. All waiting.

This is what Malik does with his days. He converts cryptocurrency. He buys assets. He builds wealth. He prepares for a future where he never works again. Where he lives on interest. Where he disappears into comfortable anonymity.

He doesn't know the blockchain trail leads directly to him. Doesn't know De Vergennes is tracking every transaction. Doesn't know DGSE has his location. Doesn't know Thomas is coming.

He thinks he's safe. He thinks Switzerland protects him. He thinks cryptocurrency anonymity shields him. He thinks fifty million francs buys security.

He's wrong.

The blockchain doesn't lie. Every bitcoin transaction is recorded. Every conversion leaves traces. Every purchase creates connections. The anonymous wallet addresses link to exchanges. The exchanges require identification. The identification connects to Malik.

De Vergennes follows the trail like a bloodhound. Every transaction. Every conversion. Every purchase. The pattern is clear. The location is known. The target is identified.

Malik is accumulating wealth in Zug. Thomas knows where. Thomas knows how much. Thomas knows what's in the safe.

Soon Thomas will come for it. All of it. The gold. The diamonds. The bonds. The watches. The cash. Everything.

Malik doesn't know. Malik goes to the gym. Malik buys groceries. Malik sits by the lake. Malik watches boats and thinks he's safe.

The safe in his closet holds fifty million francs. The safe in his closet is about to become his death sentence.

Because Thomas doesn't just want Malik dead. Thomas wants the cell's financing eliminated. Thomas wants their resources seized. Thomas wants every franc they accumulated. Every asset they bought. Every piece of wealth they stole.

Fifty million francs. That's what Malik built. That's what he's hiding. That's what Thomas is about to take.

In Marseille, De Vergennes shows Thomas the final report.

"He's there," De Vergennes says. "Confirmed location. Seestrasse 47. Third floor. Lake-view apartment. Rented under false name. But the IP addresses match. The transaction patterns match. It's him."

"How much has he accumulated?" Thomas asks.

"Approximately fifty million Swiss francs. In physical assets. Gold. Diamonds. US Treasury bonds. Watches. Cash. All in a safe. Professional grade. We'll need explosives to open it."

Thomas whistles.

"That's a fortune."

"That's what financing terrorism looks like. Donations. Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency. Three years of accumulation. All converted into portable wealth."

"When do we move?"

"The surveillance team is in position. Beaumont and Tarkovsky are watching the apartment. They've been there three days. They know his routine. They know when he leaves. They know when he's vulnerable."

"Tell me the plan."

De Vergennes pulls up the floor plan. Malik's apartment. Entry points. Exits. Safe location.

"He hosts parties," De Vergennes says. "Every week. Girls. Associates. Business partners. The parties happen at night. Loud. Chaotic. Perfect cover for entry."

"We go in during a party?"

"We go in through the lake side. Ponton access. Sliding doors. While he's distracted with guests. We enter. We secure the location. We eliminate everyone who needs eliminating. We open the safe. We take everything."

"Everyone?"

"Malik dies. That's certain. The girls and associates? That depends. If they're innocent bystanders, we let them run. If they're involved, we eliminate them too. Professional judgment in the moment."

Thomas nods. This is what black operations look like. This is what off-books DGSE work requires. Fluid situations. Split-second decisions. Professional execution.

"How do we extract with fifty million francs worth of assets?" Thomas asks.

"Vehicles staged at the ponton. Boats on the lake. We load the gold. Load the diamonds. Load the bonds. Water extraction to a safe house. Then overland to France. The Swiss authorities never know we were there."

"What about Malik's body?"

"We leave it. Or we dispose of it. Depends on the situation. If we have time, we make it look like a robbery. If we don't, we just take the assets and let the Swiss figure it out."

Thomas studies the plan. It's bold. It's complicated. It's exactly the kind of operation that could go wrong in a hundred ways.

But it's also the kind of operation DGSE operators train for. The kind of operation Thomas has run before. The kind of operation that works if everyone does their job.

"Timeline?" Thomas asks.

"Next week. Malik has a party scheduled. Friday night. We use that as our entry window. We have six days to prepare."

"I want to be there," Thomas says.

"Understood. Full team. Six operators. Coordinated assault. Professional execution. In and out in thirty minutes. Swiss authorities never know."

Thomas looks at the map. Zug. Switzerland. Malik Benhadj. Fifty million francs.

The hunt is accelerating. The cell is shrinking. The wealth is waiting.

Next week, Thomas goes to Zug. Next week, Malik dies. Next week, fifty million francs becomes Thomas's team's retirement fund.

And in Zug, Malik sits by the lake. Watches boats. Thinks he's safe. Thinks Switzerland protects him. Thinks his fortune is secure.

He has no idea what's coming.
