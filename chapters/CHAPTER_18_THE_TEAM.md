# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 18: THE TEAM

They arrive at the Marseille safe house at 8:00 PM.

Six operators. DGSE. Handpicked by the Director. Each one with experience in North Africa. Each one with skills Thomas needs.

The room smells like old coffee and sea salt. The walls are bare. The table is oak. Heavy. Permanent.

Thomas stands at the head of the table. The operators sit. They wait. They know this drill.

"I'm Thomas Dieudegard," Thomas says. "DGSE commander. This operation has full authorization from the Director. Executive level. Presidential approval. But it's deniable. We're hunting a terror cell. Five members still alive. They're scattered across the Mediterranean. We find them. We eliminate them. No arrests. No trials. No publicity."

He points to the map on the wall. Red dots marking locations.

"Target one: Malik Benhadj. Switzerland. Zug. Financial operative. Handles cell's cryptocurrency."

"Target two: Hassan Messaoud Jr. Sicily. Palermo. Operational planner."

"Target three: Amina Zeroual. Tunisia. Tunis. Communications specialist."

"Target four: Leila Hamadi. Portugal. Lisbon. Logistics coordinator."

"Target five: Yasmine Boudjellal. Algeria. Algiers, possibly moving south. Cell leader. Primary target."

The operators study the map. They understand the scope. Five targets. Four countries. Weeks of work. Maybe months.

Thomas points to the first operator.

"Your name?"

"Beaumont. Surveillance specialist. Fifteen years DGSE. Served in Lebanon, Syria, Algeria. I speak Arabic. I know North Africa."

Thomas nods. Points to the second.

"Richelieu. Weapons expert. Twelve years DGSE. Maghreb operations. I speak French and Arabic. I know how to kill quietly."

Third operator.

"Tarkovsky. Former Russian Spetsnaz. Defected in 2001. Now DGSE contractor. I speak Russian, French, Arabic. I specialize in close quarters elimination."

Fourth.

"De Vergennes. Intelligence analyst. Ten years DGSE. Financial tracking. Cryptocurrency specialist. I find money trails. I find people who think they're hidden."

Fifth.

"Leclerc. Field medic. Eight years DGSE. Combat medicine. I keep you alive. I also know anatomy well enough to kill efficiently."

Sixth.

"Moreau. Communications and technical operations. Eleven years DGSE. I handle intercepts. Surveillance. Electronics. If they use phones, computers, or radios, I hear them."

Thomas studies them. Six professionals. Six killers. Six operators who understand the mission.

"Rules," Thomas says. "One: this operation has full authority. The Director signed it. The President authorized it. But it's deniable. If we're compromised publicly, France denies we exist. The operation goes off-record. We get disavowed in the press. But privately, France protects us. Full legal support. Full extraction. Full coverage. This gives us the best of both worlds: full resources, full authority, and full deniability if needed."

Tarkovsky nods. He understands compartmentalization.

"Two: no arrests. We're not police. We're not courts. We're executioners. Each target gets eliminated. Professional. Clean. Final."

"Three: no witnesses. We operate quietly. We leave no trace. Local authorities never know we were there."

"Four: total operational security. No communications except encrypted channels. No contact with Paris except through me. No one outside this room knows what we're doing."

He looks at each operator.

"Questions?"

Beaumont speaks first.

"Timeline?"

"We start in Zug," Thomas says. "Malik is accumulating wealth. Bitcoin transactions. Cryptocurrency conversions. De Vergennes is tracking him. Once we have a location, we move."

"After Zug?"

"Sicily. Hassan Jr. is in Palermo. We eliminate him next."

"Tunisia?"

"After Sicily. Amina is in Tunis. Then Lisbon for Leila."

"And Yasmine?"

Thomas points to Algeria on the map.

"Yasmine is last. She's the cell leader. She's the primary target. She's also the hardest to reach. Algeria won't tolerate DGSE operations. We'll need Touareg contacts. Desert routes. Off-grid insertion."

"That's suicide," Tarkovsky says. His Russian accent is thick. His tone is matter-of-fact.

"Maybe," Thomas says. "But it's the mission. And it's authorized."

Richelieu speaks up.

"What's the authorization level exactly?"

"Full authority from the Director," Thomas says. "Presidential approval through executive channels. Written. Sealed. Only I've seen it. The operation is official. The operation is secret. The operation is necessary. If we're caught by foreign intelligence or police, France denies publicly. But France protects privately. Legal defense. Extraction. Cover. We're not abandoned. We're protected through deniability."

"So we're authorized but deniable," Richelieu says.

"Exactly," Thomas says. "This is the best operational position. We have full resources. Full authority. And if something goes public, France has room to maneuver diplomatically while protecting us behind the scenes."

Beaumont smiles slightly. "Plausible deniability with a safety net."

"Correct," Thomas says.

Moreau asks the technical question.

"Equipment?"

"Whatever you need," Thomas says. "Weapons, communications, vehicles, cash. The Director authorized unlimited resources. We requisition through encrypted channels. Deliveries happen through DGSE logistics. No questions asked."

"What about intelligence support?"

"Satellite surveillance when we need it. Signal intercepts when possible. But no active DGSE presence on the ground. We're it. Six operators. Five targets. That's the entire operation."

Leclerc, the medic, asks the practical question.

"Medical support?"

"You're the medical support," Thomas says. "If someone gets hurt, you fix them. If someone dies, we leave them. No evacuations. No hospitals. No medical paper trails."

Leclerc nods. He understands.

Thomas pulls out six folders. He hands one to each operator.

"Dossiers," Thomas says. "Everything we know about the targets. Photographs. Last known locations. Associates. Patterns. Financial data. Communications intercepts. Study them tonight. Tomorrow we start tracking Malik."

The operators open the folders. They read in silence. They study faces. They memorize details. They prepare.

Thomas watches them work. These are the people who will help him find Yasmine. These are the people who will help him kill the cell. These are the people he'll trust with his life.

"One more thing," Thomas says.

Everyone looks up.

"This is personal for me," Thomas says. "A friend died in the attack. Jérôme. A holiday friend. He was in the metro. He was caught in the tunnel. He burned to death. This isn't just duty. This is vengeance."

The room is silent.

"I wanted you to know that," Thomas continues. "Because it affects how I operate. I won't stop. I won't negotiate. I won't show mercy. If that's a problem, leave now."

Nobody moves.

Beaumont speaks for the group.

"We're with you, Commander."

Thomas nods.

"Then we start tomorrow. De Vergennes, you're on Malik's trail. Track his transactions. Find his location. Find his routine. By the end of the week, I want to know where he sleeps."

"Moreau, you're on communications. Monitor all known cell contacts. If anyone talks to Yasmine, I want to know what they say."

"Richelieu, you're on weapons. We need suppressed firearms. Glocks. FN P90s. Professional hardware. Quiet. Effective."

"Beaumont, you're on surveillance planning. How do we watch targets without being seen? How do we move through foreign countries without detection?"

"Tarkovsky, you're on elimination tactics. Each target requires a different approach. Close quarters. Long range. Water. Whatever works."

"Leclerc, you're on logistics. Medical supplies. Emergency protocols. Extraction routes if we need them."

The operators nod. They understand their roles. They understand the mission.

"We have five targets," Thomas says. "We have unlimited resources. We have full authorization. We have everything we need except time. The targets are scattering. They're hiding. They're building new identities. The longer we wait, the harder they'll be to find."

"So we don't wait," Thomas says. "We move fast. We strike hard. We finish this."

He looks at each operator one more time.

"Dismissed. Get some rest. Tomorrow we hunt."

The operators leave. One by one. Out into the Marseille night. Back to temporary quarters. Back to preparation.

Thomas stays in the safe house. Alone. He looks at the map. Five red dots. Five targets. Five people who helped kill his friend.

The team is assembled. The resources are allocated. The authorization is granted.

The hunt begins tomorrow.

And somewhere across the Mediterranean, the cell members are sleeping. They think they're safe. They think they escaped. They think the manhunt will fade.

They're wrong.

Thomas turns off the lights. He leaves the safe house. He walks to his hotel. He thinks about Jérôme. He thinks about the tunnel. He thinks about what's coming.

Five targets. Five eliminations. Five steps closer to Yasmine.

The team is ready.

The authorization is clear.

The hunt accelerates.
