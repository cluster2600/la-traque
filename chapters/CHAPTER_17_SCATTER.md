# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 17: SCATTER

Malik Benhadj crosses into Switzerland on the third day after the attack.

He drives a rented Renault Clio. Swiss plates. False documents. Identity that won't trigger alerts. He crosses at Basel. The border guard looks at his passport. Looks at his face. Waves him through.

Switzerland doesn't ask questions. Switzerland takes money.

Malik drives to Zurich first. Then to Zug. The banking city. The cryptocurrency capital of Europe. The place where money disappears into blockchains and numbered accounts.

He rents an apartment. Cash payment. Six months upfront. The landlord doesn't ask questions. The landlord sees cash and stops caring about identity.

Malik has work to do. Bitcoin wallets to move. Cryptocurrency to convert. Money to hide. The cell's finances are his responsibility. The operation cost money. Now the money needs to vanish.

He sets up his laptop. He opens encrypted channels. He starts moving funds. Wallet to wallet. Blockchain to blockchain. Bitcoin to Monero. Monero to Ethereum. Ethereum to cash equivalents.

The money disappears. The money reappears. The money becomes untraceable.

He's good at this. He's been doing it for years. Moving jihadist money. Funding operations. Hiding transactions from intelligence services. He's professional.

Switzerland is safe. Switzerland doesn't care. Switzerland just wants the money to keep flowing.

Malik thinks he can stay here forever.

Hassan Jr. crosses into Italy on the fourth day.

He takes a train. From Paris to Lyon. Lyon to Turin. Turin to Sicily. No flights. No airports. No passport controls he can't avoid.

He speaks Italian. Learned it from his mother. She was Sicilian. Married his father in Algiers. Divorced him in Paris. Died in Milan.

Hassan Jr. looks Italian. Dark hair. Mediterranean features. He blends in. He disappears into crowds. He becomes invisible.

In Palermo, he finds a contact. A man his father knew. A man who owes favors. The man gives him an apartment. Gives him cash. Gives him silence.

"How long?" the contact asks.

"Until it's safe," Hassan Jr. says.

"It will never be safe."

"Then until I'm dead."

The contact nods. He understands. This is how it works. You hide until they find you. You run until you can't run anymore. You live until you die.

Hassan Jr. settles into the apartment. Small. Dark. Windows overlooking the harbor. He watches boats come and go. He wonders if one of them will bring Thomas.

He doesn't know Thomas's name yet. He just knows someone is hunting. Someone is tracking. Someone won't stop until the cell is dead.

Amina Zeroual takes a bus from Paris to Barcelona.

She crosses into Spain without documents. The border is porous. The checkpoints are lazy. She's a woman. Young. Harmless-looking. The guards wave her through.

From Barcelona, she takes a ferry to Tunisia. Her mother's country. The place she was born. The place she left as a child.

Tunisia welcomes her. At least at first.

She finds a cousin in Tunis. The cousin doesn't know about Paris. Doesn't know about the bombs. Doesn't know Amina is wanted.

The cousin gives her a room. Gives her food. Asks no questions.

Amina stays quiet. Stays hidden. Waits for the news to fade. Waits for the manhunt to slow. Waits for safety.

But Tunisia is small. Tunisia has intelligence services. Tunisia cooperates with France.

The manhunt is already here. The manhunt is everywhere.

---

Farid Messaoud doesn't make it out of France.

He tries. He drives south. Toward Spain. Toward Morocco. Toward anywhere that isn't Paris.

But the checkpoints are everywhere. The police are everywhere. The roadblocks are everywhere.

He's stopped outside Toulouse. Fourth day. Police checkpoint. Routine. They're checking everyone.

"Documents," the officer says.

Farid hands over his ID. False name. False address. But his face is wrong. His nervousness is wrong. The officer sees it.

"Step out of the car," the officer says.

Farid steps out. He's thinking about running. He's thinking about fighting. He's thinking about anything except what's about to happen.

The officer calls it in. The database returns a hit. Farid Messaoud. Wanted. Connection to Paris attack. Detain immediately.

Four more officers arrive. Guns drawn. Farid is on the ground. Hands cuffed. Face in the dirt.

He's arrested. He's taken to a facility. He's interrogated.

By the end of the week, he's told them everything. Names. Locations. Financial networks. Safe houses. Contacts.

Everything.

The DGSE has a map now. A map of where the cell went. A map of who to find. A map of who to kill.

---

Leila Hamadi makes it to Portugal.

She crosses through Spain. Bus. Train. Hitchhiking. She speaks Spanish. She looks European enough. She passes through checkpoints without suspicion.

In Lisbon, she finds work. Cash jobs. Cleaning hotels. Washing dishes. Work that doesn't ask for papers.

She's invisible. She's forgotten. She's safe.

Until she isn't.

Portuguese intelligence shares information with France. Names. Faces. Suspects.

Leila's face is in the database. Her photograph. Her description. Her last known location.

It's only a matter of time.

---

Yasmine is already in Algeria. Already in Algiers. Already moving south.

She's the only one who made it clean. The only one who had the right documents. The right contacts. The right planning.

The others scattered. The others ran. The others hoped.

But only Yasmine understood the need for precision. For planning. For routes mapped in advance.

The cell is breaking apart. Scattered across the Mediterranean. Some will be caught. Some will be killed. Some will survive just long enough to regret their choices.

But Thomas is coming for all of them.

In Marseille, he's building his team. In Paris, the DGSE is analyzing intelligence. In Switzerland, Malik is moving money without knowing his blockchain trail is being traced. In Sicily, Hassan Jr. is watching the harbor without knowing surveillance satellites are watching him.

The cell scattered. The hunt accelerated.

The Mediterranean is not wide enough. Europe is not big enough. The world is not large enough to hide from what's coming.

Thomas knows where they went. Thomas knows who helped them. Thomas knows how to find them.

One by one, he will.
