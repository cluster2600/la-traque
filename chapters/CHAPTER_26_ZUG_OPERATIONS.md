# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 26: ZUG OPERATIONS

Malik is in Zug.

He's been there for three weeks. He doesn't move. He doesn't hide. He doesn't change patterns.

He just works.

His cover is wealth manager. Legitimate business. He manages money for wealthy families. Qatar families. Saudi families. Arab money that needs Swiss protection. Tax avoidance. Asset protection. Offshore storage.

The families pay him five percent management fees. That's millions per year. Perfectly legitimate income from perfectly legitimate transactions. Except the underlying money comes from cell networks. From operations. From fundraising across North Africa.

Malik takes his percentage. Keeps it in Zug. Builds his fortress.

The apartment is comfortable. Lake view. Expensive but not ostentatious. The kind of place a financial consultant would rent. Professional. Discrete.

He has a routine. Morning coffee at the same café. Walk along the lake at the same time. Lunch at a restaurant near the central square. Back to the apartment for afternoon operations.

The apartment has a desk. A laptop. Encrypted connections. Everything he needs.

He's converting cryptocurrency into physical assets. Gold. Diamonds. Bearer bonds. The conversion is slow. Methodical. Layer by layer. He doesn't rush.

This is how professionals survive. Patience. Routine. No deviation. No mistakes.

Every morning, he logs into the exchanges. Zurich. Basel. Luxembourg. Small transactions. Moving money bit by bit. Converting bitcoin to Swiss francs. Francs to gold. Gold to accounts.

The Swiss don't ask questions when you're moving money. They ask about amounts. Malik's amounts are professional. Not flash. Not desperate. Just professional.

A hundred thousand francs here. Two hundred there. Over weeks, it adds up.

By the end of month one, he has five hundred thousand francs in assets.

By the end of month two, he has one point five million.

By the end of month three, he's buying the safe.

Custom made. Swiss craftsmanship. Fireproof. Waterproof. Built into the wall of the apartment. Hidden behind a painting.

The installer is professional. He doesn't ask what goes inside. He just builds. He gets paid. He leaves.

Malik fills the safe with gold. Bars of it. Ten kilograms each. Professional storage. Untraceable wealth.

Diamonds next. Certified stones. Loose. Professional cuts. Sealed in velvet boxes.

Then the bearer bonds. US Treasury bonds. Unregistered. Direct to bearer. The ultimate untraceable currency. Tens of millions in paper.

And cash. One thousand franc notes. Stacks of them. Hundreds of thousands of francs. Organized. Careful. Professional.

He's building a nest egg. A fortress. A place where the world can't reach him.

The lake is beautiful. The apartment is safe. Switzerland feels like refuge.

But Malik doesn't feel safe. He feels hunted.

Because somewhere, across the borders, Thomas is coming.

Malik doesn't know Thomas's name. He doesn't know Thomas exists. But he knows the logic. He knows the French won't stop. He knows they're tracing the money.

So he accelerates.

He moves faster. Converts more. Buys gold by the kilogram. Accumulates wealth like a man preparing for siege.

By month four, his safe contains the equivalent of fifty million Swiss francs.

Gold. Diamonds. Bearer bonds. Cash. Everything portable. Everything untraceable. Everything hidden.

This is Malik's answer to the hunt. Not movement. Not escape. Just more gold. More security. More layers of protection.

He thinks Switzerland will protect him. He thinks the safe is impenetrable. He thinks money can stop men like Thomas.

He's wrong on all counts.

But he doesn't know it yet.

He just works. Every day. Every morning. Every transaction.

Building a grave.

Building his own ending.

One kilogram of gold at a time.
