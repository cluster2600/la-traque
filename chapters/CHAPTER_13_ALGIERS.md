# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 13: ALGIERS

The fishing boat arrives in Algiers at dawn. Yasmine is alone on deck. She's been alone for two days. Two days crossing the Mediterranean. Two days of seasickness. Two days of wondering if Thomas was behind her. If he was on the water. If he was drowning in her wake.

She doesn't see him. She makes it.

At the harbor, she stops at a shop. She buys a burka. Full coverage. Black fabric. Only her eyes visible. The vendor doesn't ask questions. Women buy burkas every day.

She puts it on. The fabric is heavy. It smells like unknown women. Unknown lives. She covers herself completely. Her face. Her body. Her identity.

The harbor is chaos. Boats everywhere. People shouting in Arabic. French. English. The smell of salt and diesel and fish. She disappears into the crowd. Now she looks Algerian. Now she belongs. Or she tries to.

She takes a taxi up the hill. Up past the old French colonial buildings. Up past the markets. Up to a small apartment that a contact arranged. A contact of a contact. Someone who knows someone who owes someone a favor.

The apartment overlooks the city. The Mediterranean is visible from the balcony. And on the hill across the way: the Monument aux Morts de la Guerre. The monument to the dead of the war. The Algerian war. The war of independence. The war that France fought against the people France colonized.

Hundreds of thousands of Algerian dead. The monument stands for them.

But the city below is dirty. Streets filled with trash. Buildings crumbling. Walls covered in graffiti. The smell of sewage and smoke. Algiers is old. Algiers is broken. Algiers is falling apart.

Yasmine sits on the balcony and looks at the monument. This is why she did it. This is why she killed three thousand French people. This monument. This memory. This refusal to forget.

But she looks at the city and she sees only decay. Only poverty. Only failure. The city her rage was supposed to liberate is a place she doesn't want to be.

But something is wrong.

On the street, people look at her. Not with recognition. With suspicion. The burka should hide her. The burka should make her invisible. But underneath, she's still wrong. Her eyes move wrong. Her walk is wrong. The way she holds herself is wrong.

She's Algerian. She speaks Arabic. She knows the culture. But she's not Algerian. She's French-Algerian. She's been in France her whole life. Her French accent is suburban Parisian (not North African). Under the burka, her clothes are too modern (she bought them in Paris). Her mannerisms are too French. Even hidden, she doesn't fit.

The burka is a costume. And underneath, everyone can tell she's wearing it.

She feels it. The distance. The way people notice her. The way the grocer studies her when she buys food. The way the café owner watches her. The way the neighborhood knows she doesn't belong.

She's seen as a foreigner.

After a week, she realizes she hates Algiers. The city is crowded. The city is loud. The city is dirty. Filthy streets. Crumbling buildings. Sewage smell. Peeling paint. Broken infrastructure. The city is not the place she imagined in her rage. The place where she would return as a hero. The place where the Algerian people would welcome her as a liberator. The city she liberated is a dump.

Nobody knows who she is.

She killed three thousand French people. She destroyed the Louvre pyramid. She bombed the Élysée Palace. She struck the Eiffel Tower. She detonated a barge at Bercy. She showed France that Algeria was not forgotten. That colonization had a price. That the dead were counting.

But in Algiers, nobody cares.

The café owner doesn't recognize her. The grocer doesn't whisper her name. The neighborhood doesn't know she's the one. Nobody has heard of Yasmine Boudjellal. Nobody knows she killed three thousand people. Nobody celebrates her.

She thought she would be a hero. She thought she would return to Algeria as a liberator. She thought the Algerian people would understand. Would embrace her. Would see her rage as their rage. Would see her violence as their justice.

Instead, she's invisible.

She walks through Algiers and nobody notices her. Not because she's hidden. Because they don't care. Because France's war is not Algeria's war anymore. Because Algerians have moved on. Because the colonial rage that burned in her for twenty-two years doesn't burn in them anymore.

They're living. Working. Raising families. Forgetting.

And she's killing.

The gap is unbridgeable.

She walks past a newspaper stand. The French attack is on the front page. "Terror in Paris." "3,000 dead." "National Tragedy." But no name. No cell. No Yasmine. Just "unknown terrorists" and "investigation ongoing." She's not famous. She's not legendary. She's just another crime in a world full of crimes.

Nobody in Algiers even knows France is burning.

The news doesn't reach here the same way. Or people don't care. Or they hear it and think: good, France deserved it, now let's go back to our lives.

There's no celebration. No street parties. No recognition.

She's alone in a city of three million people and nobody knows who she is.

She waits for the others. Malik should arrive within a week. Hassan Jr. within two weeks. Amina after three. They'll find her. They'll understand her. They'll see her the way she sees herself: as a liberator. As a warrior. As someone who changed history.

But no one arrives.

After two weeks, no Malik. After three weeks, no Hassan Jr. After a month, no Amina.

No one.

She tries to reach them through the network. The contacts. The safe houses. The message is always the same: disappeared. Captured. Assumed dead.

Malik never made it out of France. The intercepts caught him. The interrogation broke him. Or maybe it didn't break him. Maybe he just told them what they wanted to know. Either way, he's gone.

Hassan Jr. died in the crossing. Or he was caught at the border. Or he made it to Libya and was turned over to the authorities. No one knows for certain. Only that he's not in Algiers.

Amina made it as far as Tunisia. Then disappeared. The network assumes police. Assumes detention. Assumes dead or imprisoned.

Yasmine is alone.

After six weeks in Algiers, she makes a decision. But before she leaves, she goes to the museum.

The Museum of Martyrs. The place where Algeria remembers its dead. Hundreds of thousands of names. Thousands of photographs. Men. Women. Children. All killed in the war of independence. All sacrificed so Algeria could be free.

She walks through the museum in silence. She looks at the faces. She reads the names. She sees the photographs of torture. The photographs of massacres. The photographs of French soldiers with their prisoners. The photographs of Algerian bodies in ditches.

This is why she killed three thousand people.

This is the debt. This is the memory. This is the reason.

She stands in front of a photograph. A girl. Maybe ten years old. Shot by French soldiers. The girl's name is beneath the photograph. Fatima Aouet. Born 1947. Died 1961. Fourteen years old.

Yasmine touches the glass. She doesn't cry. She just touches it. Like she's making contact with the dead. Like she's telling Fatima: I'm sorry. I tried. I killed three thousand of them. It wasn't enough.

She walks through the rest of the museum. Every photograph is a debt. Every name is a scream. Every death is a reason.

By the time she exits, she understands something. The museum doesn't see her. The dead don't recognize her. She killed three thousand people and the dead are still not satisfied. The debt is still unpaid. The memory is still incomplete.

She's not a liberator. She's just another person trying to pay an impossible debt.

But she tried. That has to mean something.

She leaves the museum. Before finding the Touareg driver, she makes a phone call. A secure line. A number she's memorized. A contact she hasn't used in weeks.

The finance guy answers. Hassan Boudjellal. Her cousin. The one who moved money. The one who funded the operation. The one who never left Paris.

"It's me," she says.

Silence on the line. Then recognition.

"You made it," he says.

"I made it."

"The others?"

"Gone. All of them. Malik. Hassan Jr. Amina. All gone."

Another silence. Longer this time. Then:

"So it's just you."

"It's just me," she confirms. "The cell is only me now."

"What will you do?"

She doesn't answer immediately. She looks out the window. At the city that rejected her. At the monument she honored. At the museum she just left.

"I'm going south," she says. "To Tadrart."

"For what?"

"For the end," she says.

She hangs up. Hassan is already moving. She hears him on the other end making calls. Arranging. Coordinating.

Within an hour, a text message arrives: "Driver waiting at the Sofitel. Toyota. 11 AM. Walk there. He knows where to take you."

Yasmine walks. Through the dirty streets of Algiers. Through the crowds. Through the smell of sewage and garbage. The Sofitel is on the hill. Modern hotel. International. The last place anyone would expect to find her. She walks for an hour. Through the city she hates. Through the city that rejects her. To the hotel that waits.

At 11 AM, a Toyota Land Cruiser pulls up in front of the Sofitel. An old model. Desert-worn. The kind of vehicle that's crossed the Sahara a thousand times. The driver is Touareg. Dark-skinned, blue robes, veiled. A professional. Not a smuggler. A driver. Someone Hassan hired.

"Hassan sent me," the driver says in French. The only words he speaks.

She gets in the passenger seat. They drive south. Out of Algiers. Out of the city that rejected her. Out toward the desert.

Two days of driving. Two days of sand. Two days of silence between them. The driver doesn't ask questions. The driver doesn't care who she is. Hassan paid him. That's all that matters.

By the second evening, the landscape changes. Mountains appear. The desert hardens. The driver points ahead.

"Tadrart," he says.

They arrive at a small house. On the edge of town. Made of stone. Simple. Anonymous. Hassan's house. A safe house. A place prepared in advance. A place waiting for her.

The driver stops the car. He gives her a key. He leaves. He drives back north without saying goodbye.

She enters Hassan's house. Two servants appear immediately. A man and a woman. They don't introduce themselves. They don't ask questions. They know Hassan. They know to take care of her. The man brings tea. The woman brings fresh bread. They move silently through the house. Professional. Hassan's people.

The house is small but comfortable. There's food in the kitchen. Water in the containers. A bed in the corner. Money on the table. Servants to care for her. Enough for weeks. Enough for waiting.

Hassan thought of everything. Hassan prepared. Hassan knew she would need a refuge. Hassan even provided people to take care of her. Hassan's network. Hassan's final care.

She doesn't know why she chooses a Touareg driver. Maybe because he's not Algerian. Maybe because he won't see her as a foreigner. Maybe because the Touareg don't care about French wars or Algerian independence. They have their own struggles. They have their own honor codes.

The driver's car is old. A beaten-down Toyota. The kind of car that has crossed the Sahara a thousand times. The kind of car that will cross it again.

They leave at dawn.

She doesn't know why. She just knows she can't stay in Algiers. The city rejects her. The city sees her as French. The city doesn't understand what she did. The city doesn't care about her rage.

But maybe the desert will understand. Maybe the mountains will understand. Maybe the place where her rage was born will understand.

The Touareg drives in silence. Two days. Three days. The car rumbles. The desert stretches. Endless. Flat. Unchanging. Until suddenly it changes. Until mountains appear. Until the land gets harder. Until the Touareg points ahead.

"Tadrart," he says. The only word he speaks the entire journey.

The town is small. The town is poor. The town is the end of the road. The place where the car stops and everyone gets out because there's nowhere else to go.

She enters Hassan's house. She closes the door. She looks at the room. The bed. The water. The money. The food. Hassan arranged all of this from Paris. Hassan prepared a refuge.

She sits on the bed. She looks out the window at the desert. At the mountains. At the place where everything ends.

She has money. She has a house. She has a refuge. She has rage. She has the knowledge that she killed three thousand people and it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough to change anything. It wasn't enough to make France apologize. It wasn't enough to make the world notice.

But Hassan understands. Hassan prepared. Hassan knew she would survive Algiers and need a place to wait.

She sits in her room. She looks out the window at the desert. At the mountains. At the place where everything ends.

She's misunderstood everywhere.

In France, they see her as a terrorist. A killer. A threat to be eliminated.

In Algeria, they see her as a foreigner. A French person playing at Algerian identity. Someone who doesn't belong.

Nobody sees her as she sees herself: a liberator. A warrior for justice. Someone fighting for the forgotten dead.

She killed three thousand people and nobody understands why. Nobody sees the righteous rage behind the bombs. Nobody sees the colonial debt being paid. Nobody cares.

She's alone in her comprehension. Alone in her rage. Alone in her mission.

And she waits.

She doesn't know what she's waiting for. She doesn't know what comes next. She just knows that Thomas is coming. She can feel it. The way she felt the bombs detonate. The way she felt the pyramid fall. The way she felt France burning.

Thomas will understand. Not why she did it. But that she did it. He'll see her as a worthy opponent. As someone who matters. As someone whose actions have consequence.

Thomas is coming.

And when he arrives, she'll finally be seen.
