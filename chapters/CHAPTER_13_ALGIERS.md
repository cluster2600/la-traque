# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 13: ALGIERS

The fishing boat arrives in Algiers at dawn. Yasmine is alone on deck. She's been alone for two days. Two days crossing the Mediterranean. Two days of seasickness. Two days of wondering if Thomas was behind her. If he was on the water. If he was drowning in her wake.

She doesn't see him. She makes it.

The harbor is chaos. Boats everywhere. People shouting in Arabic. French. English. The smell of salt and diesel and fish. She disappears into the crowd. She's Algerian. She belongs here. Or she should.

She takes a taxi up the hill. Up past the old French colonial buildings. Up past the markets. Up to a small apartment that a contact arranged. A contact of a contact. Someone who knows someone who owes someone a favor.

The apartment overlooks the city. The Mediterranean is visible from the balcony. And on the hill across the way: the Monument aux Morts de la Guerre. The monument to the dead of the war. The Algerian war. The war of independence. The war that France fought against the people France colonized.

Hundreds of thousands of Algerian dead. The monument stands for them.

Yasmine sits on the balcony and looks at the monument. This is why she did it. This is why she killed three thousand French people. This monument. This memory. This refusal to forget.

But something is wrong.

On the street, people look at her. Not with recognition. With suspicion. She's Algerian. She speaks Arabic. She knows the culture. But she's not Algerian. She's French-Algerian. She's been in France her whole life. Her accent is wrong. Her clothes are wrong. Her mannerisms are wrong.

She feels it. The distance. The way people notice her. The way the grocer studies her when she buys food. The way the café owner watches her. The way the neighborhood knows she doesn't belong.

She's seen as a foreigner.

After a week, she realizes she hates Algiers. The city is crowded. The city is loud. The city is not the place she imagined in her rage. The place where she would return as a hero. The place where the Algerian people would welcome her as a liberator.

Instead, she's a stranger. A foreigner. Someone who left and came back. Someone who doesn't belong anymore.

She waits for the others. Malik should arrive within a week. Hassan Jr. within two weeks. Amina after three. They'll find her. They'll reassure her. They'll make sense of this displacement.

But no one arrives.

After two weeks, no Malik. After three weeks, no Hassan Jr. After a month, no Amina.

No one.

She tries to reach them through the network. The contacts. The safe houses. The message is always the same: disappeared. Captured. Assumed dead.

Malik never made it out of France. The intercepts caught him. The interrogation broke him. Or maybe it didn't break him. Maybe he just told them what they wanted to know. Either way, he's gone.

Hassan Jr. died in the crossing. Or he was caught at the border. Or he made it to Libya and was turned over to the authorities. No one knows for certain. Only that he's not in Algiers.

Amina made it as far as Tunisia. Then disappeared. The network assumes police. Assumes detention. Assumes dead or imprisoned.

Yasmine is alone.

After six weeks in Algiers, she makes a decision. She leaves the apartment. She takes what money she has. She takes a bus. A long-distance bus heading south. South to the desert. South to the place she's never been. South to the place where the Algerian war was fought most brutally. South to the mountains and the plains where France lost everything.

South to Tadrart.

She doesn't know why. She just knows she can't stay in Algiers. The city rejects her. The city sees her as French. The city doesn't understand what she did. The city doesn't care about her rage.

But maybe the desert will understand. Maybe the mountains will understand. Maybe the place where her rage was born will understand.

She buys a ticket. She boards the bus. She watches Algiers disappear behind her. The Mediterranean fading. The monument aux morts getting smaller and smaller until it's gone.

By nightfall, she's in the Sahara.

The bus stops in small towns. People get on. People get off. Nobody pays attention to the young woman who keeps her head down. Nobody asks questions. Nobody cares.

She sleeps on the bus. She wakes to the sound of the engine. She watches the desert pass. Endless. Flat. Unchanging. Until suddenly it changes. Until mountains appear. Until the land gets harder. Until she reaches Tadrart.

The town is small. The town is poor. The town is the end of the road. The place where the bus stops and everyone gets off because there's nowhere else to go.

Yasmine gets off the bus. She's carrying a small bag. She has money. She has rage. She has the knowledge that she killed three thousand people and it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough to change anything. It wasn't enough to make France apologize. It wasn't enough to make the world notice.

She finds a hotel. A small place. The kind of place that doesn't ask for documents. The kind of place that takes cash and doesn't care who you are.

She sits in her room. She looks out the window at the desert. At the mountains. At the place where everything ends.

And she waits.

She doesn't know what she's waiting for. She doesn't know what comes next. She just knows that Thomas is coming. She can feel it. The way she felt the bombs detonate. The way she felt the pyramid fall. The way she felt France burning.

Thomas is coming.

And when he arrives, she'll face him.
