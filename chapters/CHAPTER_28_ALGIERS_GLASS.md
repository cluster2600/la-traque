# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 28: ALGIERS GLASS

Algiers looks familiar in photographs.

In reality it feels like a trap.

Yasmine steps off the fishing boat at dawn. Salt on her skin. Diesel in her hair. The smell of rotting fish and seawater.

The harbor is loud. Men shouting. Trucks backing up. Cranes lifting containers.

She blends into the crowd for maybe ten seconds.

Then she feels it.

Eyes.

Not recognition.

Judgment.

She's wearing jeans and a hoodie. French clothes. French posture.

She stands out.

She buys a burka from a vendor near the docks. Cash. No questions.

The fabric is heavy. It smells like old sweat. Like women she doesn't know. Like a country she's never lived in.

She puts it on anyway.

She thinks it will make her Algerian.

It doesn't.

She takes a taxi up the hill. Past French colonial buildings with peeling paint. Past monuments. Past broken sidewalks where trash collects in corners.

Algiers sprawls across the hillside. White buildings stacked on top of each other. The Mediterranean glitters below.

Beautiful and broken at the same time.

The safe apartment is small. Overlooks the sea. Hassan's contact left food and water. Bread. Bottled water. Canned goods.

Yasmine sits on the balcony. Sees the Monument aux Morts. The monument to French colonial dead.

That's supposed to feed her rage.

It doesn't.

The city below is trash and traffic and broken concrete. Not the Algeria of her imagination. Not the martyred nation of her mother's stories.

Just a city. Struggling. Indifferent.

She goes out for bread on the first day.

The baker looks at her too long.

"You're not from here," he says in Arabic.

Yasmine answers in Arabic.

Correct words. Correct grammar.

Wrong music.

Her accent betrays her. French vowels. Suburban rhythm. Mantes-la-Jolie bleeding through every syllable.

The baker doesn't smile.

"France," he says.

Not as a question.

As a verdict.

Yasmine buys bread and leaves.

Her hands shake as she walks back. She feels exposed. Visible.

In the stairwell, an old woman watches her climb. Eyes sharp. Suspicious.

Yasmine keeps her head down.

Back in the apartment, she takes off the burka. Looks at her hands. French manicure. She scrapes at it with a knife until her nails look ruined. Blood under one nail. Pain.

She tries to erase France from her skin.

It stays.

She tries to erase France from her voice.

It stays.

She is a ghost in her own heritage.

Too French for Algeria.

Too bloody for France.

She waits for the others.

No calls. No knocks.

Days pass.

She watches Algerian television. The Paris attack is a headline for a day. Politicians condemn it. Then it's football. Then it's politics. Then it's nothing.

No street celebrations.

No hero worship.

No one says her name.

She isn't a martyr here.

She's a rumor in a foreign country.

She thought Algeria would embrace her. Understand her. See her as a daughter returning.

Instead Algeria looks at her like a stranger.

Because that's what she is.

After a week she walks to the Museum of Martyrs.

The building is stark. White. Official.

Inside: photographs. Names. Faces.

Children.

Torture.

Mass graves.

The Algerian war of independence. French colonial violence. A million dead.

She stands in front of the glass over a photograph of a girl.

Fourteen years old.

Shot by French soldiers.

Her body lies in dust. Eyes open. Blood pooled around her.

Yasmine touches the glass.

She wants to feel something.

Connection. Rage. Purpose.

She feels only distance.

France feels far away now.

Algeria feels farther.

She doesn't belong to either.

She leaves the museum and calls Hassan.

Secure line. Prepaid phone. Ten seconds of connection.

"It's me," she says.

Hassan's voice is tired. Strained.

"You made it," he says.

"The others?"

"No news. Stay quiet."

"I'm not quiet," Yasmine says. "People look at me. They know I'm French."

"Then don't go out."

"I can't stay locked in a room."

"You have to."

She hates being told what to do.

But she listens.

"I can't stay here," she says.

Silence. Then Hassan sighs.

"Then you go south," Hassan says. "Tadrart. I prepared a place."

"When?"

"Tomorrow. A driver will meet you. Sofitel lobby. Seven AM."

"Is it safe?"

"Safer than Algiers. Remote. Touareg territory. No government. No police. No cameras."

"And you?"

"I'm going to Sicily. Malik is going to Switzerland. We scatter. We disappear. That was always the plan."

"And if they find us?"

"They won't."

The line dies.

Yasmine stands in the street with the phone in her hand.

Algiers moves around her. Loud. Indifferent.

She wanted to be a soldier. A revolutionary. A martyr for the cause.

Instead she's a fugitive. Alone. Unwanted.

She walks back to the apartment. The sun sets behind the hills. The city lights flicker on.

At night she lies awake. Listening to traffic. To voices through walls. To the call to prayer echoing across rooftops.

She is too French for this country.

And too bloody for France.

She is glass.

Seen.

Fragile.

About to break.

Somewhere in France, Thomas is assembling intelligence. Satellite photos. Signal intercepts. Financial transactions.

He doesn't know where she is yet.

But he's close.

The net is forming.

And glass doesn't survive nets.

It shatters.
