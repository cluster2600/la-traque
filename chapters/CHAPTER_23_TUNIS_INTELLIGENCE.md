# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 23: TUNIS INTELLIGENCE

Moreau catches the signal at 14:17.

Encrypted app. Short burst. Tunis.

He doesn't smile. He doesn't celebrate.

He records. He tags. He triangulates.

Then he calls Thomas.

"It's Amina," Moreau says. "Voiceprint match. She's in Tunis. Medina."

Thomas is in Marseille. Standing over the board. Red dots. Red X.

The afternoon light comes through dirty windows. The room smells like sweat and instant coffee.

He looks at Tunisia.

"How sure?" he asks.

"Ninety percent," Moreau says. "She called a cousin. She wants to move south. She thinks pressure is coming."

"Good," Thomas says. "Pressure makes people sloppy."

Moreau sends the transcript.

It is short.

Amina: *I need to move.*

Cousin: *Where?*

Amina: *Somewhere they won't look.*

Cousin: *Why?*

Amina: *Because they're closing in.*

No names. No details.

But fear has a shape.

And fear makes calls.

Thomas reads it twice. He memorizes the tone. The rhythm. The urgency.

Amina is nervous. That means she's movable. That means she'll make mistakes.

He calls Richelieu.

"You and Leclerc go to Tunis," he says. "Liaison. Quiet. No freelance. We coordinate with the Tunisians."

"Understood," Richelieu says.

The Tunisian service answers DGSE's request in one hour.

They want cooperation. They want French money. They want French training.

They also want terrorists out of their capital.

A man named Karim meets Richelieu and Leclerc near Avenue Bourguiba.

The street is loud. Cars honking. Vendors shouting. Heat rising off concrete.

Karim speaks French. He looks tired. Dark circles under his eyes. The kind of tired that comes from chasing ghosts in a city that doesn't want to be watched.

"We have a building," Karim says. "Rue du Pacha. Cellular hit in the area. Cousin lives there."

"Area isn't an address," Richelieu says.

Karim nods.

"The medina eats addresses," he says. "Old walls. Thick stone. Signals bounce. We get blocks, not doors."

Leclerc looks at the map Karim hands over.

Narrow streets. Courtyards. Dead ends.

A place built to confuse.

A place built to hide.

"We watch," Richelieu says.

They watch.

Two teams. Tunisian plainclothes on one side. Richelieu and Leclerc on the other.

They sit in a parked van. Windows tinted. Camera lenses pointed at the door.

They watch the cousin.

He is ordinary. Thirty-five. Market worker. Leaves at six. Returns at seven. Carries bread.

He wears cheap shirts. Plastic sandals. He doesn't look like a man harboring terrorists.

But families are complicated.

And blood runs deeper than law.

At 19:42, the cousin stops at a phone shop.

Buys a SIM.

Pays cash.

Leaves without talking.

At 19:55, he makes a call.

Moreau hears the burst from Marseille.

New number. Same voice.

Amina.

"She's moving," Moreau says on the secure line.

Thomas leans in.

"Where?" he asks.

"Not sure," Moreau says. "But she asked about boats. Ferries. Europe."

Portugal.

Spain.

Anywhere with crowds.

Thomas hears it.

Amina isn't going south.

She's going west.

Karim hears it too, from his own intercepts.

He stiffens.

"She'll try to leave tonight," he says. "Airport or port."

Richelieu doesn't argue.

"We move," he says.

They hit the building at 22:30.

Front door keys. Tunisian maintenance copies. No broken locks.

Quiet.

Professional.

Third floor. Apartment at the end of the hall.

Richelieu enters first. Suppressed pistol up. Leclerc behind him.

The apartment is small.

Kitchen. Living room. Bedroom.

The air smells like couscous and old sweat.

No body.

No woman.

Just an unmade bed and a half-empty bottle of water.

The sink is still wet. She left recently. Maybe an hour. Maybe less.

Leclerc checks the bathroom.

Empty.

Soap is dry. Towel is damp.

Richelieu checks the closet.

Empty.

Hangers on the rod. Nothing else.

On the table is a Tunisian passport.

Not hers.

The cousin's.

And a bus ticket.

Tunis to Bizerte.

Midnight.

Port city.

Ferries.

Smugglers.

Karim sees the ticket and swears softly in Arabic.

"She used him," he says.

"She used everyone," Richelieu says.

They don't chase to Bizerte.

Not on Tunisian roads.

Not without clear legal cover.

Thomas told them: no freelance.

They stay within the roof.

They stay authorized.

They call Marseille.

"Apartment empty," Richelieu reports. "She moved fast. We found a ticket to Bizerte. Likely trying Europe."

Thomas closes his eyes for one second.

Not frustration.

Calculation.

He opens them. Looks at the map.

"She's heading to Portugal," Thomas says.

"Why?" Leclerc asks.

"Because she already tried Tunisia," Thomas says. "Small country. Too much cooperation. Portugal is noise. Portugal is tourists. She thinks she can blend."

He pauses.

"Good," he says. "Let her run. Running leaves prints."

He looks at the board.

Tunisia stays red.

Portugal glows brighter.

The hunt moves west.

Amina escaped tonight.

But she didn't disappear.

She just changed the map.

And every change is a mark.

Every movement is data.

Thomas hangs up. He updates the board. Red arrow from Tunis to Lisbon.

Richelieu and Leclerc return to the safe house. Karim walks them to the door.

"We'll keep listening," Karim says. "If she calls again, we'll tell you."

"Thank you," Richelieu says.

Karim nods. He looks tired. But satisfied. Cooperation works both ways.

The van drives through Tunis at midnight. Empty streets. Streetlights flickering. The medina sleeps.

But somewhere on a bus to Bizerte, Amina sits by a window. She thinks she escaped.

She doesn't know the net is already forming in Lisbon.

She doesn't know Portugal is just another box.

She thinks running west means freedom.

It doesn't.

It means delay.

And delay is just time for Thomas to position his people.

The bus crosses the dark Tunisian countryside. Amina stares out the window. She sees nothing but her own reflection.

A woman alone.

A woman hunted.

A woman who thinks distance is safety.

It isn't.
