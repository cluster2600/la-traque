# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 27: MARSEILLE SHADOWS

Thomas returns to Marseille three days after Yasmine leaves.

He doesn't know that yet. He only knows she was here.

The city sprawls under Mediterranean sun. White buildings. Blue water. Heat rising off pavement.

Marseille smells like fish and diesel and old garbage. The port is loud. Vendors shout. Cars honk. Scooters weave through traffic.

Thomas walks through Noailles. Narrow streets. Market stalls. Spices. Fabric. North African faces everywhere.

This is where Jérôme brought him once. Years ago. A holiday. They ate bouillabaisse at a restaurant overlooking the Vieux-Port. They drank pastis. They talked about nothing important.

Jérôme loved this city. The noise. The chaos. The mix of cultures.

Thomas didn't understand it then.

He understands it now.

Marseille is a place where people hide. Where identity blurs. Where North Africa and Europe collide.

Perfect for someone like Yasmine.

He meets Beaumont at a café near the harbor.

Beaumont sits with an espresso. Sunglasses on. Watching the boats.

Thomas sits.

"She was here," Beaumont says.

"How do you know?"

"Harbor sources. Dock workers. Cash conversations. A woman matching her description boarded a fishing boat three nights ago. Paid Rachid. Small-time smuggler. Algerian route."

Thomas looks at the harbor. Boats everywhere. Fishing vessels. Yachts. Ferries.

"Where's Rachid now?"

"At sea. Won't be back for a week."

"When he returns?"

"We have people watching. He'll talk."

Thomas nods.

He looks across the water. The horizon is sharp. Blue meeting blue.

Somewhere across that water, Yasmine landed. Algiers. Or maybe further.

"Tell me about the safe house she used," Thomas says.

"Studio apartment. Noailles. Above a kebab shop. Rented through an intermediary. Cash. No names."

"Who owns it?"

"Hassan's contact. Low-level. We're watching him."

"Don't touch him yet," Thomas says. "Let him think he's safe. We need the network intact. If we burn sources now, the others scatter."

Beaumont nods.

"And the DGSE station here?" Thomas asks.

"Limited support. The Director wants us independent. No local entanglements. We use liaison channels for intelligence. But operational decisions are ours."

Thomas drinks his espresso. It's bitter. Strong. The way Marseille does everything.

He thinks about Jérôme. Walking these same streets. Eating at these same cafés.

Dead now. Burned in a tunnel. Because of Yasmine. Because of the cell.

That thought keeps him sharp.

"What about Algiers?" Thomas asks.

"We have satellite coverage. NSA is sharing signals intelligence. But Algeria is difficult. No DGSE presence. No official cooperation. If we go in, we go dark."

"I know."

"The Director approved it?"

"Full authorization. Written. Sealed. Off-books but official."

Beaumont whistles softly.

"Presidential level?"

"Yes."

"Then we're committed."

"We were always committed," Thomas says.

They sit in silence. The harbor moves around them. Tourists. Sailors. Fishermen.

Normal life.

But Thomas isn't living normal life anymore.

He's living the hunt.

"Moreau is tracking communications," Thomas says. "De Vergennes is following money. If Yasmine makes contact with anyone, we'll know."

"And if she doesn't?"

"Then we use the others. Malik. Hassan. They'll lead us to her."

Beaumont finishes his espresso.

"How long do you think we have?"

"Weeks," Thomas says. "Maybe less. The longer she's underground, the harder she is to find."

"Then we move fast."

"We move precisely," Thomas corrects. "Fast is sloppy. Precise is final."

Beaumont nods.

Thomas stands. He drops cash on the table.

"I want updates every six hours. Communications. Financial transactions. Any movement from the cell contacts."

"Understood."

Thomas walks back through Noailles. He passes the studio where Yasmine stayed. He doesn't go in. He doesn't need to.

He just needs to know she was here.

That she left a trail.

That the trail continues south.

He stops at the Vieux-Port. Looks at the water.

Jérôme stood here once. Smiling. Happy. Alive.

Thomas doesn't smile.

He just watches the boats.

One of them carried Yasmine away.

One of them completed the line from Paris to Algiers.

From attack to refuge.

From terrorism to desert.

Thomas turns away.

Marseille was her escape route.

It won't be her salvation.

The harbor has ears. The boats have records. The network has cracks.

And Thomas has time.

Not much.

But enough.

He walks back to the safe house. The afternoon sun burns his neck. The city smells like salt and exhaust.

This is where the chase pivoted.

From Europe to Africa.

From visible to invisible.

From fast hunt to patient siege.

Thomas doesn't mind.

Patient works.

Patient finds people.

And when patient finds Yasmine, she'll understand that distance doesn't equal safety.

It just equals delay.

And delay is what Thomas uses to position his people.

To prepare.

To strike.

Marseille fades behind him as he enters the safe house.

Inside, the map glows on the wall.

Red dots. Red X. Red arrows.

The hunt continues.
