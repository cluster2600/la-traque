# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 9: GUNFIRE

The shot echoes through the cathedral.

Thomas's bullet hits Hassan in the shoulder. Hassan goes down. The rifle falls. Hassan is screaming. Not from pain. From rage.

Inès fires.

The bullet comes fast. It hits Rousseau. The young tactical officer goes down. Blood on the limestone floor.

Thomas fires again. This time at Inès. She ducks behind the metal table. The bombs are still there. Four of them. Any stray bullet could detonate them.

Hassan is moving. He's pulling a knife from his belt. He's standing up. He's charging.

Thomas doesn't shoot. He can't. One bullet in the wrong direction and the bombs detonate.

Hassan reaches him. The knife goes for Thomas's throat. Thomas moves left. The blade misses. Catches his shoulder instead. Blood. Pain. Focus.

Thomas drops the rifle. He uses Hassan's momentum against him. Flips him over. Hassan hits the limestone floor hard. The breath goes out of him.

But Hassan is trained. He rolls. He comes back. The knife is still in his hand. It's wet with Thomas's blood.

Inès is still behind the table. She's reaching for something. Not a gun. Something else. A detonator. A switch.

"Shoot her," Thomas says to one of the tactical officers.

The officer fires.

Inès is hit. Her arm goes up. The detonator falls. She's screaming. She's trying to reach it but she can't. Her arm is useless.

The detonator is on the ground. Fifteen meters from Thomas. Between him and Yasmin.

Yasmin hasn't moved. She's still standing. Watching. Smiling that smile.

"You can't stop this," Yasmin says. "Even if you kill us. Even if you take the detonator. We've already activated the sequence. The bombs will detonate in ninety seconds. The tunnel will collapse. Everyone above will die. Everyone below will die. You. Me. All of us. We all go into the earth together."

Thomas doesn't believe her. But it doesn't matter. He has to assume it's true.

Hassan is coming at him again. The knife is ready. Thomas sees the kill move. He's trained for this. He takes Hassan's wrist. Breaks it. The knife falls.

Hassan screams. Thomas doesn't stop. He drives his knee into Hassan's stomach. Hassan folds. Thomas strikes his neck. Hassan goes limp.

Hassan isn't dead. But he's unconscious.

Sixty seconds.

Thomas picks up the detonator. It's not a detonator. It's a remote. A wireless remote. With a blinking light. Red. Blinking fast. The light is the countdown.

Thomas doesn't know how to stop it.

Moreau is there. He takes the remote. He's a soldier. He's seen explosives before.

"It's just a remote," Moreau says. "Destroying it won't stop the sequence. The bombs are on a timer. Mechanical. No way to stop them."

Forty-five seconds.

Thomas looks at Yasmin.

She's still smiling.

"Why aren't you running?" Thomas asks.

"Because I'm already dead," Yasmin says. "I died in 1954 when my great-grandmother was tortured by the French. I died in 1962 when my grandfather died in a French prison. I died a thousand times in a thousand Algerian graves. So I might as well die here. Might as well take you with me. Might as well make sure France remembers."

Thirty seconds.

Thomas grabs her. He's carrying her. She's not fighting. She's just letting him carry her.

"Go," Thomas tells Moreau. "Up. Get everyone up. Use the collapsed tunnel. Dig if you have to. Get them out."

"You're staying?" Moreau asks.

"I'm staying," Thomas says.

Twenty seconds.

The other tactical officers are already moving. They're carrying Rousseau. The medic is keeping pressure on the wound. They're running toward the collapsed tunnel. Climbing. Digging. Moving.

Ten seconds.

Thomas is still holding Yasmin. She's light. Almost fragile. Almost human. But she's not. She's an idea. An idea that wants to die.

Five seconds.

Four.

Three.

Two.

One.

The bombs detonate.

But not where Thomas is standing. The detonation is behind him. In a side passage. A tunnel that Thomas didn't see. A tunnel where Yasmin must have placed charges before they arrived.

The limestone collapses. The explosion is massive. The cathedral shakes. The ceiling cracks. Stone rains down.

Thomas pulls Yasmin and runs.

He's heading toward the collapsed tunnel. Toward where the team went. Toward up. Toward light.

Yasmin is struggling now. She's trying to get away. Trying to get back to the cathedral. Trying to let the collapse take her.

Thomas doesn't let her go.

The ceiling is coming down. Behind him. Above him. Around him. The darkness is falling.

He reaches the collapsed tunnel section. He starts climbing. Yasmin is fighting him. She's hitting him. She's screaming in Arabic. Prayers maybe. Curses maybe. It doesn't matter.

Thomas climbs. One hand. One foot. The other hand. The other foot. Pulling Yasmin up with him.

Behind them, the cathedral is collapsing. The bombs. The table. The four bombs that were going to kill thousands. They're all under the rubble now.

Thomas reaches the surface.

He emerges from the tunnel like he's being born. Gasping. Bleeding. Covered in limestone dust. Still holding Yasmin.

Moreau is there. The team is there. They're all alive. Rousseau is unconscious. The medic is working on him. But he's alive.

Thomas releases Yasmin.

She's on her knees. She's crying. Not from fear. From rage. From the knowledge that she's alive. That she didn't get to die. That she's being captured.

Thomas sits down next to her.

He's breathing hard. His shoulder is bleeding. His ribs hurt. He might have broken something. He doesn't care.

They're alive.

The bombs are buried. The plot is stopped. The cell is captured.

It's over.
