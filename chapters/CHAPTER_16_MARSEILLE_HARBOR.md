# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 16: MARSEILLE HARBOR

The Falcon 7X lands at Marseille Provence Airport at 7:04 AM.

Thomas exits onto the tarmac. A car is waiting. Black Peugeot 607. Government plates. Driver in civilian clothes. DGSE. Professional.

"Commander Dieudegard," the driver says. "I'm Beaumont. Your contact in Marseille."

Thomas nods. Gets in. The car moves immediately. No delays. No questions.

"Where to?" Beaumont asks.

"The old harbor," Thomas says. "Vieux-Port."

Beaumont drives fast. He knows the city. He knows the route. He knows what Thomas needs before Thomas asks.

The harbor appears fifteen minutes later. Morning light on water. Boats everywhere. Fishing vessels. Private yachts. Ferries to Corsica. Ferry to Algeria. Ferry to Tunisia. The Mediterranean starts here. From this harbor, people disappear south.

Thomas gets out. Beaumont follows.

"What are we looking for?" Beaumont asks.

"Boats that left in the last forty-eight hours," Thomas says. "Destination: North Africa. Algeria. Tunisia. Libya."

"That's a lot of boats."

"Then we have work to do."

The harbormaster's office is at the north end. Small building. Windows facing the water. Thomas enters. Beaumont stays outside. Watching. Professional.

The harbormaster is old. Sixty. Gray beard. He's seen everything. He's suspicious of everyone.

Thomas shows his DGSE credentials.

"I need your departure logs," Thomas says. "Last seventy-two hours. Any vessel heading south across the Mediterranean."

The harbormaster studies the credentials. Studies Thomas. Studies the authority behind the request.

"This about Paris?" the harbormaster asks.

Thomas doesn't answer. Just waits.

The harbormaster nods. He understands. He pulls out a ledger. Paper. Handwritten. Old-school record keeping.

"Seventeen departures," the harbormaster says. "Ferries. Private boats. Fishing vessels. Most headed to Algiers. Three to Tunis. One to Tripoli. One to Tangier."

"I need names," Thomas says. "Passenger manifests. Crew lists. Everything."

"Ferries keep manifests. Private boats don't always."

"I need everything you have."

The harbormaster copies names onto a sheet. Thomas takes it. Seventeen vessels. Maybe two hundred people total. Somewhere in that list is someone who knows where Yasmine went.

Thomas goes back outside. Beaumont is waiting.

"We talk to everyone," Thomas says. "Captains. Crew. Dock workers. Anyone who saw something in the last three days."

"That's a lot of people."

"Then we work fast."

They start at the north dock. A fishing boat. The captain is loading nets. Old man. Weathered face. Marseille accent.

Thomas approaches.

"DGSE," Thomas says. Shows credentials. "I need to ask about recent departures."

The captain looks at the credentials. Looks at Thomas. Looks at Beaumont.

"What do you need?" the captain asks.

"Did you see a woman? Early twenties. Algerian features. Traveling alone. Maybe nervous. Maybe in a hurry."

The captain thinks about this. He's thinking about what he saw. What he noticed. What he remembers.

"Maybe," he says. "Three days ago. A girl. Young. She talked to Rachid."

"Who's Rachid?"

"Rachid Bouazza. Runs a fishing boat. Takes passengers sometimes. Side business. Cash only. No manifests."

"Where is he now?"

"Left yesterday morning. Destination Algiers. Should arrive tonight."

Thomas writes this down. Rachid Bouazza. Fishing boat. Algiers.

"You remember anything else about the girl?"

"She looked scared," the captain says. "Like she was running from something."

Thomas nods. That's her. That's Yasmine.

"Thank you," Thomas says.

They move to the next boat. Same questions. Same process. By noon, Thomas has talked to twelve captains. Five remember seeing a young woman. Three remember her talking to Rachid. One remembers she paid cash. A lot of cash.

"She's on Rachid's boat," Beaumont says.

"Was on Rachid's boat," Thomas corrects. "She's in Algiers now. Or close to it."

"What do we do?"

Thomas thinks about this. Yasmine is across the Mediterranean. In Algeria. Maybe in Algiers. Maybe already gone inland. The trail is forty-eight hours cold.

"We go after her," Thomas says.

"Algeria won't let DGSE operate on their soil," Beaumont says. "Not officially."

"Then we operate unofficially."

Beaumont understands what that means. Black operation. No authorization. No backup. No rescue if something goes wrong.

"You need a team," Beaumont says.

"I know."

Thomas pulls out his phone. He calls the Director. Secure line. The Director answers immediately.

"I found her trail," Thomas says. "She crossed to Algiers. Fishing boat. Cash payment. Left three days ago."

"You want to follow," the Director says. It's not a question.

"I need a team. Six operators. Professional. Experienced in North Africa. Full authorization for black operations on Algerian soil."

Silence on the line. The Director is thinking. Calculating. Measuring risk against necessity.

"I can give you the team," the Director says. "But Algeria is sensitive. If you're caught, we disavow. You understand?"

"I understand."

"I'll have the team in Marseille by tonight. You have seventy-two hours to organize. After that, you're on your own."

"That's all I need."

The Director hangs up.

Thomas looks at Beaumont.

"We need a safe house," Thomas says. "Somewhere we can brief the team. Somewhere secure."

"I know a place," Beaumont says.

They drive east. Away from the harbor. Into the industrial district. Old warehouses. Abandoned buildings. Beaumont stops at a nondescript building. Gray concrete. No windows on the ground floor.

"DGSE safe house," Beaumont says. "We use it for Mediterranean operations."

They go inside. Empty space. Concrete floor. Metal chairs. Table. Map of North Africa on the wall. This is where operations are planned. This is where teams prepare.

Thomas spreads the notes on the table. Seventeen boats. Two hundred names. Rachid Bouazza. Algiers. Yasmine.

The trail is getting clearer. The hunt is accelerating. By tonight, he'll have a team. By tomorrow, they'll have a plan. By the end of the week, they'll be in Algeria.

And somewhere in Algiers, Yasmine is waiting. She doesn't know Thomas is coming. She doesn't know the trail she left. She doesn't know that Rachid's boat captain talked to a weathered fisherman who talked to DGSE.

She thinks she's safe.

She's wrong.

Thomas looks at the map. Marseille to Algiers. Two hundred fifty kilometers. Twelve hours by boat. Six hours by helicopter. Two hours by jet.

The Mediterranean is not as wide as Yasmine thinks.

The hunt is crossing the water.
