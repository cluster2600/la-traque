# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 14: PARIS RESPONSE

While Yasmine sits in Hassan's house in Tadrart, France is tearing itself apart.

The President has called an emergency cabinet meeting. The military is mobilized. The entire government is in crisis mode. Three thousand dead. Four major symbolic targets destroyed. One barge attack. The nation has been struck in a way it hasn't since World War II.

The first action: save the artifacts.

The Louvre pyramid is destroyed. But the museum is not. The Louvre's collection is France's soul. The government orders immediate evacuation. Every painting. Every sculpture. Every artifact. Loaded onto trucks. Driven to secure locations. Museums across France open their vaults. The collection is scattered. Protected. Hidden.

It takes days. Teams of soldiers. Protective suits. Careful handling. By the end, the Louvre is empty. The building stands. The collection survives.

But the message is clear: France is afraid.

The DGSE mobilizes immediately. The crime scenes are analyzed. The Louvre plaza. The Élysée palace grounds. The Eiffel Tower base. The Bercy riverside. Evidence is collected. Forensics teams work around the clock.

Within forty-eight hours, they have preliminary findings.

The explosives are military-grade. The detonation timing is synchronized. The target selection is strategic. This is not a random attack. This is coordinated terrorism. This is a cell.

The DGSE begins interviews. Survivors. Witnesses. Police. Military. Everyone who was present. Everyone who saw something.

The evidence points in one direction: the northern suburbs. Mantes-la-Jolie.

Chemical purchases traced to Mantes. Safe houses in Mantes. Cell members identified as having connections to Mantes. The lab is in Mantes. The operation is based in Mantes.

Within a week, the DGSE converges on the city.

The police arrive first. Then the military. Then the intelligence agents. They sweep through Mantes-la-Jolie like an occupying force. They search every building. They interrogate every resident. They look for the lab. They look for evidence. They look for the cell.

They find the warehouse. The laboratory. The equipment. The chemicals. The records.

They find proof of the operation.

By then, the city is in chaos. The increased police presence. The military checkpoints. The random interrogations. The invasions of privacy. Young men stopped on the street for no reason except their appearance. Families dragged from their homes. Searches without warrants. Questions without answers.

But there's another crisis. The drug trade has stopped. The dealers can't operate. The police are everywhere. The checkpoints stop every car. The surveillance is total. No deals. No money. No income.

The young men who sell drugs to survive are losing everything. The money that fed their families. The economy that kept the suburbs alive. The informal system that worked when the government didn't.

The residents of Mantes-la-Jolie are scared. They're angry. They're insulted. They're targeted. And they're broke.

The riots begin.

Young men gather in the streets. Not just angry. Desperate. They throw rocks. They burn cars. They build barricades. They're fighting for their livelihood. The police respond with tear gas. With rubber bullets. With violence.

The military arrives.

The government makes a decision: evacuate the city.

By the end of the week, the entire population of Mantes-la-Jolie is being moved. Fifty thousand people. Removed from their homes. Placed in camps. Temporary housing made from tents and shipping containers. Guarded by military. Monitored by intelligence.

The camps are built on the outskirts of Paris. In the fields. In the industrial zones. Rows of containers. Rows of tents. Thousands of people living in confinement.

There's no due process. No charges. No trials. Just evacuation. Just confinement. Just fear.

The government's message is clear: we will protect France. We will do whatever is necessary. We will suspend your rights if we must.

The people of Mantes-la-Jolie are prisoners in their own country.

In Tadrart, Yasmine hears the news through Hassan's radio. The BBC reports it. France 24 reports it. The entire world is watching France descend into authoritarianism.

Fifty thousand people evacuated. Fifty thousand people imprisoned. All because of what she did.

She doesn't feel triumph. She doesn't feel vindication. She just feels the weight of it. The reality of the consequence. The people suffering. The families separated. The homes abandoned.

The debt is still being paid. The price is still being extracted. Not from France. From her own people.
