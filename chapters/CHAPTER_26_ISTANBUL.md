# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 26: ISTANBUL

Malik doesn't go straight to Switzerland.

He goes east first. Turkey.

Istanbul. The old routes. The old networks. The old money.

He flies out of Paris using a forged passport. Moroccan identity. Real document. Bought, not made. Paid in cash. Delivered in a plastic bag near Barbès.

At Charles de Gaulle, nobody looks twice. The airport is chaos after the attacks. Lines. Armed police. Nervous travelers. Everyone is suspicious. Everyone is a potential threat.

That makes Malik just one more face.

He wears a suit. Carries a briefcase. Looks like business. Bland. Forgettable.

He lands at Atatürk. Hot air. Diesel. Crowds pressing through passport control.

Turkish stamps his passport without looking up.

Welcome to Istanbul.

He takes a taxi to Fatih. Old neighborhood. Narrow streets. Religious bookstores. Cash exchanges. Men who don't ask questions. Mosques with minarets that pierce the sky.

The city smells like exhaust and grilled meat and centuries of empire.

He checks into a cheap hotel. No cameras. Cash only. The clerk hands him a key without asking for ID.

That night he eats kebab at a street stall. Watches people. Listens to Turkish conversations he doesn't understand.

He waits.

The next morning he meets a man in a back room above a kebab shop.

The man is Syrian. Forty. Sharp eyes. Professional.

War refugee turned money broker.

The room smells like spices and cigarette smoke. A single window overlooks an alley. No security cameras. No digital footprint.

"You brought the keys?" the man asks in Arabic.

Malik nods. Hands over a sheet of paper. Wallet addresses. Private keys. Twelve of them. The cell's seed money.

Bitcoin. Ethereum. Monero.

Digital gold buried in the blockchain.

The Syrian checks the paper. Reads it. Memorizes it. Burns it in an ashtray.

Malik watches the paper curl and blacken.

"You want conversion," the Syrian says.

"I want assets," Malik says. "Physical. Portable. Untraceable."

"Gold?"

"Gold. Diamonds. Bonds."

The Syrian smiles.

"Europe is panicking," he says. "They want to watch banks. They want to watch wires. They freeze accounts. They ask questions. They don't know how to watch this."

He taps the table. Meaning: crypto.

"How long?" Malik asks.

"Two days," the Syrian says. "I'll start moving it. Small transactions. Multiple exchanges. Layer by layer. By the time it reaches you, it's clean."

"And the premium?"

"Twenty percent."

Malik doesn't argue. Twenty percent is standard. Fair for risk.

"Deal," Malik says.

The Syrian extends his hand. They shake.

"You'll need a place to go after," the Syrian says. "Switzerland. Zug. I have contacts."

Malik nods. He's already thought about Switzerland. Neutral. Secure. A place where money talks louder than law.

He waits in the cheap hotel. He doesn't sleep much. He watches Turkish news. French news. The manhunt. The photos. The chaos.

France is burning with grief. Politicians give speeches. Police raid apartments. Mosques are vandalized.

Yasmine's face isn't on TV. Not yet. France doesn't know her name. Not publicly. Malik takes comfort in that.

But he knows the DGSE will find them. He knows Thomas exists even if he doesn't know his name. He knows the French don't forgive.

He waits anyway.

Two days later, the Syrian returns with a bag.

Heavy.

He sets it on the table. Opens it.

Gold. Small bars. One kilogram each. Easy to carry. Easy to hide. Worth thirty thousand euros apiece.

Swiss refinery stamps. Legitimate.

"Twenty bars," the Syrian says. "Six hundred thousand euros."

Malik checks them. Real. Stamped. Serial numbers filed smooth.

He lifts one. Feels the weight. Cold. Dense. Permanent.

"More," Malik says.

"More comes later," the Syrian says. "We move in layers. Blockchain to cash. Cash to assets. Assets across borders. Slow. Quiet. Fast gets you caught."

Malik nods. He understands. Slow is safe.

"And this," the Syrian says.

He slides a folder across the table.

Inside: Swiss bank introductions. Names. Contacts. Zug. Zurich. People who can rent apartments without questions. People who can source safes. People who can buy bearer bonds.

"Switzerland," the Syrian says. "You're better there. Turkey is transit. Switzerland is refuge."

Malik takes the folder.

"Why help me?" Malik asks.

The Syrian shrugs.

"Because you paid," he says. "Because France will hit the wrong people looking for you. Because networks survive by moving money, not by choosing sides."

Malik leaves that night.

Bus to Edirne. Border crossing into Bulgaria. Then up through Eastern Europe. No flights. No passport control that can be flagged easily.

He carries the gold in a backpack.

Twenty kilograms. Heavy. But manageable.

He doesn't look like a man carrying six hundred thousand euros.

That's the point.

Five days later, he enters Switzerland at Basel.

Train from Bulgaria. Clean passport. Tourist visa.

Swiss border police wave him through.

Welcome to Switzerland.

He has gold. He has contacts. He has a folder that says: Zug.

He rents an apartment by the lake. Pays six months in advance. Cash.

The landlord doesn't blink.

Malik thinks he's running.

He's actually building a grave.

He just doesn't know it yet.

The lake is beautiful. The mountains are pristine. Switzerland feels like safety.

It isn't.

It's just geography.

And geography doesn't stop men like Thomas.
