# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 2: SAINT-LAZARE

The MV Agusta Brutale cuts through Paris traffic like a blade. Four cylinders screaming. 6,500 RPM on the Boulevard Saint-Michel. Thomas leans into the turn. No hesitation. The bike responds. Two hundred horsepower transferred through titanium and discipline.

He keeps the speedometer below 100. Just barely. The morning traffic parts. Drivers see the bike and move. It's not aggression. It's inevitability. A force moving through space. Nothing can stop it. Nothing should try.

The Brutale turns onto Rue Saint-Lazare. Thomas can see the station entrance. Police. Fire brigade. Emergency vehicles everywhere. The street is chaos. Not organized chaos. French chaos. Three different agencies arguing about jurisdiction. Two ambulances parked in conflicting directions. A fire chief yelling at a police captain about who's in command. News crews trying to set up behind barriers that keep moving. Someone's radio is playing the national anthem. A taxi driver is trying to deliver a passenger to the station entrance. Firefighters standing with blueprints arguing about which floor is where. An old woman demanding to be let through because she has a 3:00 PM appointment at Sephora.

Nobody is in charge. Everyone is in charge. It's France.

He parks the bike illegally. Three other motorcycles are parked illegally next to it. Police see him. Don't care. The key comes out. The engine dies. Silence. The bike ticks as it cools.

Thomas walks toward the command center. His phone rings. Work phone. Moreau.

"Where are you?"

"Walking in now."

"They're saying the middle car is completely dark. No power. They're trying to establish communication through the tunnel walls."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's thinking about the geometry. The tunnel under Paris. Modern. Limestone-based. Still fragile. The middle car trapped between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare for three kilometers. A tomb. But a tomb they can open. If they're careful. If they're fast.

He hangs up. Keeps walking.

**FLASHBACK: TOKYO, 2004**

It's raining in Tokyo. It's always raining in Tokyo. Thomas is 26 years old and he's been in the city for three weeks. The embassy posting is nominal. Attaché. Political affairs. It's a cover. His real work is surveillance.

The target is Chirac's son. Age seventeen. His mother is Japanese. The son is a student at Lycée français de Tokyo. Thomas follows him to the school. Watches. Keeps distance. Nothing suspicious. Nothing worth the effort.

One afternoon, Thomas is at Starbucks near the school. Waiting. Watching. A woman comes in. She's tall. Very tall. Japanese features. Dark hair. She orders in perfect Japanese. Switches to French with the barista. Then English with the next person in line.

Her name is Taka. She's a replacement teacher at Lycée français de Tokyo. Full Japanese. Born in Quebec to Japanese parents. Lived there until age fifteen. Then moved to Tokyo with her family. Fluent in French, Japanese, and English. She teaches French literature. She covers classes when the regular teachers are absent.

Thomas notices her because his job is noticing. She works at the school. She could be connected to the target. She could be anything.

Over the next two weeks, Thomas observes her routine. Starbucks. School. Library. Home. Nothing suspicious. But also: intelligent. Observant. Careful.

By week three, he's certain she's not connected to the target. By week four, he's certain he wants to know her.

He approaches her at Starbucks. Casual. Not surveillance. Just a man. Just a question.

"You're at the school, aren't you? Lycée français?"

She smiles. "How did you know?"

"I recognize people. It's what I do."

She laughs. "That's a weird superpower."

Over the next weeks, they talk. At Starbucks. At the school gates. At restaurants. She tells him about her life. Born in Quebec. French-speaking childhood. Then Tokyo at fifteen. Japanese family, French education, living in Japan. Speaking French to her parents. Japanese to everyone else. English as the bridge. Never quite belonging to any country. Always being a little bit foreign.

He understands this. His childhood in Normandy was foreign. Rhodesia haunted it. His Navy training was foreign. Intelligence work is foreign. Everything is foreign.

Maybe that's why they fit.

By week twelve, they're in a hotel room overlooking the Shinjuku skyline. She's sleeping. Thomas watches the city lights reflect in her eyes. He's thinking about the mission. He's thinking about duty. He's thinking about how easily duty can be compartmented when you're good at your job.

When you're very good.

He doesn't tell her about the mission. He tells her about Normandy. About his family. About the wine his mother lost in Rhodesia. He tells her about his brother Louis and his sister Victoire. He tells her everything except the one thing that matters.

The mission ends in March 2005. Thomas gets recalled. The target was Chirac's son. Nothing criminal. Just verification. Just paranoia. Just politics.

Thomas tells Taka he has to leave.

She cries. He doesn't.

He marries her a year later. Some things you do because they're right. Some things you do because the alternative is worse. He's never been sure which category applies.

By 2018, they have a child. By 2018, they live on opposite sides of the world.

Duty did that.

Duty does that.

The command center is set up on the square in front of Saint-Lazare station. Between two fire trucks. Tactical maps on a folding table. Radio operators coordinating. Moreau is here. Colonel Dubois from the fire brigade. A negotiator named Leclerc. Technical specialists checking structural integrity.

Thomas walks between the fire trucks.

Moreau looks up.

"Status," Thomas says.

"No communication with the middle car. Power is out. The structural engineer says the tunnel walls are stable for now. But the weight of the trains on either side of the trapped car is creating pressure. If we don't move them, there's risk of collapse."

"Timeline?"

"The fire brigade can have evacuation equipment in place in eight minutes. First rescue team ready to go in ten."

Thomas studies the map. The middle car is trapped between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare. Three kilometers of tunnel. The tunnel walls are limestone under Paris. Modern, but still fragile. The two trains on either side are creating pressure. The weight is significant.

"We move the forward train first," Thomas says. "Slowly. Back toward Châtelet. One meter per minute. Then establish communication through the tunnel."

"The track is damaged," Dubois says. "Moving it risks collapse."

"Keeping it in place risks the same thing," Thomas says. "We move it. Slowly."

Dubois doesn't like this. His face shows it. But he nods.

"I'll coordinate with the operators."

Thomas turns to Moreau.

"I want to go in with the probe team."

"Negative. You coordinate from here."

"I'm going in with the probe team."

Moreau doesn't argue. He's learned not to. When Thomas says something with that tone, it's already decided. The argument is just a formality.

"Fine. But you're not making rescue decisions. You're observing. You report back. That's it."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's already pulling on tactical gear. Black. Minimal. Everything he needs. Nothing he doesn't.

The MV Agusta Brutale sits outside in the morning rain. It will still be there in six hours. Or it won't. Either way, it doesn't matter. The bike is compartmented. The wife is compartmented. The child is compartmented.

Right now there's only the tunnel.

Right now there's only the darkness and the people trapped inside it.

Right now there's only the mission.

Thomas has been training for this his entire life. Since age sixteen. Since Jérôme died and taught him that delay is death and precision is survival.

The probe team is ready at 6:19 AM.

Thomas walks into the tunnel.
