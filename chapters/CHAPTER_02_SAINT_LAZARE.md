# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 2: SAINT-LAZARE

The MV Agusta Brutale cuts through Paris traffic like a blade. Four cylinders screaming. 6,500 RPM on the Boulevard Saint-Michel. Thomas leans into the turn. No hesitation. The bike responds. Two hundred horsepower transferred through titanium and discipline. 1000cc engine. Pure power.

He keeps the speedometer below 100. Just barely. French units. The morning traffic parts. Drivers see the bike and move. It's not aggression. It's inevitability. A force moving through space. Nothing can stop it. Nothing should try.

The Brutale turns onto Rue Saint-Lazare. Thomas checks his watch: 6:26 AM.

It's been one minute and six seconds since Moreau's command.

Thomas can see the station entrance ahead. Police. Fire brigade. Emergency vehicles everywhere. The street is chaos. Not organized chaos. French chaos. Three different agencies arguing about jurisdiction. Two ambulances parked in conflicting directions. A fire chief yelling at a police captain about who's in command. News crews trying to set up behind barriers that keep moving. Someone's radio is playing the national anthem. A taxi driver is trying to deliver a passenger to the station entrance. Firefighters standing with blueprints arguing about which floor is where.

The ambulance at the Cour de Rome entrance was supposed to be part of the rescue operation. A mobile ICU unit. It had been positioned to receive the first wounded from the tunnel. It was parked at the dome entrance—the main pedestrian access point. The perfect location to intercept the injured and begin emergency treatment.

But it was booby-trapped.

Four tons of homemade nitroglycerine.

Thomas is exactly fifty meters away when it detonates.

Then the second explosion.

Four tons of homemade nitroglycerine.

Not professional military explosive. Not precision equipment. Raw, volatile, homemade. Compressed into the ambulance chassis. Wired for remote detonation. Positioned at the Cour de Rome dome entrance—the main pedestrian entry point to the Saint-Lazare station complex.

The blast is massive. Not tidy. Not controlled. A compression wave that detonates the entire ambulance structure simultaneously. Metal fragmentation everywhere. Shrapnel traveling at velocities calculated to penetrate tissue and bone.

The goal was clear: collapse the entrance. Block the rescue route. Cut off emergency access. Force the rescue teams to use the tunnel entrance exclusively. Force them into the ground where the body count could be maximized.

Thomas sees the blast unfold. The orange fireball. The twisted metal rising into the air. The black smoke. The shock wave hitting his bike hard—hard enough that he nearly loses control. He leans into it. Compensates. Keeps the Brutale upright.

The ambulance is no longer an ambulance. It's wreckage. It's fire. It's proof that this attack is not finished. The first explosions were in the tunnel. This explosion is at the station entrance. Coordinated. Systematic. Designed to prevent rescue.

The second act of the same attack.

Thomas kills the engine and parks the Brutale illegally. Two police officers are standing frozen, staring at the explosion site. They don't even notice the bike.

Thomas parks the Brutale illegally. Two police officers are staring at the explosion site. They don't even notice the bike.

Thomas walks toward what used to be the command center. Debris. Broken equipment. Moreau pulling himself out from under a collapsed table. Blood on his temple.

"Go to Saint-Lazare now," Moreau manages. His voice is not a suggestion. It's a direct command. "The entrance is compromised. They're using the rear access. Tunnel entrance. East side. Go. Now."

Thomas moves without hesitation.

**FLASHBACK: TOKYO, 2004**

It's raining in Tokyo. It's always raining in Tokyo. Thomas is 26 years old and he's been in the city for three weeks. The embassy posting is nominal. Attaché. Political affairs. It's a cover. His real work is surveillance.

The target is Chirac's son. Age seventeen. His mother is Japanese. The son is a student at Lycée français de Tokyo. Thomas follows him to the school. Watches. Keeps distance. Nothing suspicious. Nothing worth the effort.

One afternoon, Thomas is at Starbucks near the school. Waiting. Watching. A woman comes in. She's tall. Very tall. Japanese features. Dark hair. She orders in Japanese. Sits. Opens a book. "Les Fleurs du Mal" by Baudelaire. In French.

Thomas notices because his job is noticing. She's reading French poetry in a Tokyo Starbucks. She's at the school. She could be connected to the target. She could be anything.

She looks up from the book. Makes eye contact. Smiles.

Thomas doesn't smile back. But he notices.

Her name is Taka Tachibana. She's a replacement teacher at Lycée français de Tokyo. Full Japanese. Born in Quebec to Japanese parents (Tachibana family). Lived there until age fifteen. Then moved to Tokyo with her family. She teaches French literature. She covers classes when the regular teachers are absent.

Over the next two weeks, Thomas observes her routine. Starbucks. School. Library. Home. Same book. Different pages. Nothing suspicious. But also: intelligent. Observant. Careful.

By week three, he's certain she's not connected to the target. By week four, he's certain he wants to know her.

He approaches her at Starbucks. Casual. Not surveillance. Just a man. Just a question.

"Les Fleurs du Mal," he says. "Baudelaire in Japanese."

She smiles. "French. I read it in French. Better that way."

"Why?"

"Because Baudelaire deserves to be read in his own language. Even in Tokyo."

Over the next weeks, they talk. At Starbucks. At the school gates. At restaurants. She tells him about her life. Born in Quebec. French-speaking childhood. Then Tokyo at fifteen. Japanese family, moved to Japan, teaching French. Never quite belonging to any country. Always being a little bit foreign.

He understands this. His childhood in Normandy was foreign. Rhodesia haunted it. His Navy training was foreign. Intelligence work is foreign. Everything is foreign.

Maybe that's why they fit.

By week twelve, they're in a love hotel in Shinjuku. Room overlooking the neon streets below. She's sleeping. Thomas watches the city lights reflect in her eyes. He's thinking about the mission. He's thinking about duty. He's thinking about how easily duty can be compartmented when you're good at your job.

When you're very good.

He doesn't tell her about the mission. He tells her about Normandy. About his family. About the wine his mother lost in Rhodesia. He tells her about his brother Louis and his sister Victoire. He tells her everything except the one thing that matters.

The mission ends in March 2005. Thomas gets recalled. The target was Chirac's son. Nothing criminal. Just verification. Just paranoia. Just politics.

By then, Taka is pregnant.

Thomas tells her he has to leave. She cries. He doesn't.

He marries her because he loves her. Because he's a man with a code. You don't leave a woman carrying your child. You don't compartmentalize her away. You marry her. You do the right thing. Even if it costs you everything.

By 2018, they have a child. By 2018, they live on opposite sides of the world.

Duty did that.

Duty does that.

The rear access to the tunnel is secured. Police are establishing a perimeter. Thomas moves through it. No ID check. His bearing is authority. His clothes are tactical. People move out of his way.

The tunnel entrance is dark. The emergency lighting was damaged by the ambulance blast. Thomas pulls a flashlight from his pack. The tunnel stretches ahead. Black. Cold. Limestone under Paris.

The distance to Saint-Lazare proper is 1.5 to 2 kilometers. Not three. Not what the early reports said. The geometry is different. The risk is different.

A probe team is assembling at the entrance. Fire brigade. EMTs. Two structural engineers. They look at Thomas. They wait.

"I'm going in with the team," Thomas says. "I coordinate."

Nobody argues. His tone doesn't allow argument.

The team moves into the darkness.

The tunnel is a tomb. But a tomb they can open. If they're careful. If they're fast.

They walk. Two hundred meters. The flashlights catch the walls. Limestone. Water seepage. Cold. The smell of ozone from the electrical fire. Smoke still in the air.

Thomas is thinking about the logic. Two bombs. The first attack on the trains themselves. The second on the rescue infrastructure. The pattern is clear. Whoever did this doesn't want rescue. Doesn't want survivors. Wants maximum chaos. Maximum death.

At the 300-meter mark, they find the first body. A woman. Age unknown. Burned. The shock wave from the main explosion caught her. She was trying to escape toward the Châtelet entrance when the blast hit.

The team moves forward without stopping.

At 600 meters, they find survivors. A group of five. Huddled near the tunnel wall. Alive. Conscious. Scared.

"Can you walk?" Thomas asks.

They nod. One woman has a broken arm. One older man is limping.

"Walk behind us. Back to the entrance. Don't stop. Don't look behind. Just walk."

They move back toward rescue.

Thomas continues forward with the probe team.

The middle car is ahead. One more kilometer. The tunnel curves. The darkness deepens. The air gets thicker.

When they reach the train car, they find hell.
