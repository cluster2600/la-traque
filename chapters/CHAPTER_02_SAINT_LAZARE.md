# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 2: SAINT-LAZARE

The MV Agusta Brutale cuts through Paris traffic like a blade. Four cylinders screaming. 6,500 RPM on the Boulevard Saint-Michel. Thomas leans into the turn. No hesitation. The bike responds. Two hundred horsepower transferred through titanium and discipline.

He keeps the speedometer below 100. Just barely. The morning traffic parts. Drivers see the bike and move. It's not aggression. It's inevitability. A force moving through space. Nothing can stop it. Nothing should try.

The Brutale turns onto Rue Saint-Lazare. Thomas can see the station entrance. Police. Fire brigade. Emergency vehicles. The street is chaos. Organized chaos. But still chaos.

He parks the bike illegally. Nobody's going to ticket him today. The key comes out. The engine dies. Silence. The bike ticks as it cools.

Thomas walks toward the command center. His phone rings. Work phone. Moreau.

"Where are you?"

"Walking in now."

"They're saying the middle car is completely dark. No power. They're trying to establish communication through the tunnel walls."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's thinking about the geometry. The tunnel under Paris is limestone. Nineteenth-century work. Fragile. The middle car trapped between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare is basically a tomb. But it's a tomb they can open. If they're careful. If they're fast.

He hangs up. Keeps walking.

**FLASHBACK: TOKYO, 2004**

It's raining in Tokyo. It's always raining in Tokyo. Thomas is 26 years old and he's been in the city for three weeks. The embassy posting is nominal. Attaché. Political affairs. It's a cover. His real work is surveillance.

The target is Chirac's son. Age thirty-two. His mother is Japanese. His father pulled strings to keep him out of the French press. Thomas is here to verify something. No one will say what.

Thomas follows him through the city. Keeps distance. The target goes to work. Comes home. Meets with people. Nothing suspicious. Nothing worth the effort.

One afternoon, Thomas is at Starbucks on Omotesando. Watching the street. Watching the target's building across the way.

A girl sits at the next table. She's young. Maybe nineteen. Japanese face. French accent. She's reading Sartre. "L'Être et le Néant." In the original French. In a Starbucks. On a Wednesday afternoon.

Thomas notices because his job is noticing. He catalogs her. Appearance. Behavior. Accent. Likelihood of being connected to the target.

She looks up. Makes eye contact. Smiles.

Thomas doesn't smile back. But he notices this too.

Her name is Taka. She's a student at Lycée français de Tokyo. Her father is Japanese. Her mother is French-Canadian. She speaks four languages. She laughs at the right moments. She asks questions that suggest intelligence.

Over the next six weeks, Thomas sees her at Starbucks. Same table. Same time. Same book, different pages.

It might be coincidence. Thomas doesn't believe in coincidence.

By week seven, he's certain she's not connected to the target. By week eight, he's certain he wants to see her again.

By week twelve, they're in a hotel room overlooking the Shinjuku skyline. She's sleeping. Thomas watches the city lights reflect in her eyes. He's thinking about the mission. He's thinking about duty. He's thinking about how easily duty can be compartmented when you're good at your job.

When you're very good.

He doesn't tell her about the mission. He tells her about Normandy. About his family. About the wine his mother lost in Rhodesia. He tells her about his brother Louis and his sister Victoire. He tells her everything except the one thing that matters.

She tells him about her life in Tokyo. About being between worlds. About speaking French at home and Japanese at school and English everywhere else. About never quite belonging to any country. About always being a little bit foreign.

He understands this. His childhood in Normandy was foreign. Rhodesia haunted it. His Navy training was foreign. Intelligence work is foreign. Everything is foreign.

Maybe that's why they fit.

The mission ends in March 2005. Thomas gets recalled. The target was Chirac's son. Nothing criminal. Just verification. Just paranoia. Just politics.

Thomas tells Taka he has to leave.

She cries. He doesn't.

He marries her a year later. Some things you do because they're right. Some things you do because the alternative is worse. He's never been sure which category applies.

By 2018, they have a child. By 2018, they live on opposite sides of the world.

Duty did that.

Duty does that.

The command center is in a converted warehouse three blocks from Saint-Lazare station. Tactical maps on the walls. Live feeds from the tunnel. Teams coordinating on radio. Moreau is here. Colonel Dubois from the fire brigade. A negotiator named Leclerc. Technical specialists checking structural integrity.

Thomas enters without knocking.

Moreau looks up.

"Status," Thomas says.

"No communication with the middle car. Power is out. The structural engineer says the tunnel walls are stable for now. But the weight of the trains on either side of the trapped car is creating pressure. If we don't move them, there's risk of collapse."

"Timeline?"

"The fire brigade can have evacuation equipment in place in eight minutes. First rescue team ready to go in ten."

Thomas studies the map. The middle car is 147 meters from Châtelet station. 189 meters from Saint-Lazare. The tunnel walls are limestone. Nineteenth-century reinforcement is minimal. The two trains on either side are creating pressure. The weight is significant.

"We move the forward train first," Thomas says. "Slowly. Back toward Châtelet. Then we send in a probe team through the Saint-Lazare entrance. Establish communication with the trapped civilians. Assess injuries. Then we decide the evacuation route."

"The forward train operators say the track is damaged," Dubois says. "Moving it risks further collapse."

"Keeping it in place risks the same thing," Thomas says. "We move it. Slowly. One meter per minute. The pressure decreases. The structural risk decreases."

Dubois doesn't like this. His face shows it. But he nods.

"I'll coordinate with the operators."

Thomas turns to Moreau.

"I want to go in with the probe team."

"Negative. You coordinate from here."

"I'm going in with the probe team."

Moreau doesn't argue. He's learned not to. When Thomas says something with that tone, it's already decided. The argument is just a formality.

"Fine. But you're not making rescue decisions. You're observing. You report back. That's it."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's already pulling on tactical gear. Black. Minimal. Everything he needs. Nothing he doesn't.

The MV Agusta Brutale sits outside in the morning rain. It will still be there in six hours. Or it won't. Either way, it doesn't matter. The bike is compartmented. The wife is compartmented. The child is compartmented.

Right now there's only the tunnel.

Right now there's only the darkness and the people trapped inside it.

Right now there's only the mission.

Thomas has been training for this his entire life. Since age sixteen. Since Jérôme died and taught him that delay is death and precision is survival.

The probe team is ready at 6:19 AM.

Thomas walks into the tunnel.
