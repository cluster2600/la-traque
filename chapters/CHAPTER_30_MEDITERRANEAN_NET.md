# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 30: MEDITERRANEAN NET

Thomas runs the hunt from Marseille.

He doesn't chase ghosts with instinct.

He builds a net.

The safe house overlooks the old port. Three rooms. Maps on every wall. Laptops on every surface. Encrypted radios. Satellite phones.

A war room disguised as an apartment.

He has French naval assets off the coast. Frigates. Patrol craft. Maritime surveillance aircraft sweeping shipping lanes.

He has liaison officers in Tunis and Lisbon. Portuguese cooperation. Tunisian intelligence sharing.

He has Swiss coverage through financial channels. Banks. Cryptocurrency exchanges. Money always leaves traces.

He has satellites.

American NSA cooperation. French military reconnaissance. Real-time imagery of North Africa.

And he has six operators who don't sleep much.

Moreau builds the communications picture.

Cell towers. SIM registrations. IMEI numbers. Encrypted app identifiers.

Every beep becomes data.

Every silence becomes a clue.

He sits at a laptop. Three screens. Code scrolling. Signal intercepts. Voiceprint analysis.

"Nothing from Yasmine in four days," Moreau reports. "She's disciplined."

"Or scared," Thomas says.

"Same result. Silence."

De Vergennes builds the money picture.

Wallets. Exchanges. IP addresses. Bitcoin transactions traced through the blockchain.

Every transaction becomes a line on a map.

"Malik is building his nest in Zug," De Vergennes says. "Moving funds directly. Cryptocurrency to Swiss exchanges. Exchanges to gold, diamonds, bonds. All in Zug. He's not moving. He's staying put and accumulating."

"How much?"

"Millions. Probably tens of millions by now. He's been working for weeks. Professional conversion. Layer by layer. Building an impenetrable fortress."

Thomas marks Zug on the map. Red circle.

"That's our next target," Thomas says.

Beaumont builds the human picture.

Patterns.

Routines.

Habit.

Humans can't stop being human. Even terrorists.

They eat.

They sleep.

They call someone when they're scared.

Thomas uses that.

"Hassan Jr. has a routine in Palermo," Beaumont reports. "Café. Gym. Apartment. Same pattern every day. Arrogant. Thinks he's invisible."

"Good," Thomas says. "Arrogance is fatal."

On Thursday he gets two confirmations.

Richelieu. Tunis. Amina eliminated.

Leclerc. Lisbon. Leila eliminated.

Two red dots on the map turn into red X.

Thomas marks them. No celebration.

No speeches.

Just updates.

Work continues.

Three days later Beaumont and Tarkovsky report from Palermo.

Hassan Jr. eliminated.

Third red X.

The cell is collapsing.

And still Yasmine sits in Algeria thinking time protects her.

Thomas doesn't know she's in Tadrart yet.

He only knows she crossed the water.

He only knows Algiers.

He asks Paris for satellite coverage.

The Director calls back within an hour.

"Algeria is sensitive," the Director says. "We can collect. We can't act. Not officially."

"I don't need official," Thomas says.

"You do," the Director says. "You stay within mandate. You stay clean. No freelance. No diplomatic incidents. Algeria is not Tunisia. They don't cooperate. They don't forgive."

Thomas hears it.

A warning.

Also a promise.

Support, as long as he stays under the roof of authorization.

"Then give me collection," Thomas says.

"Done. NSA will share imagery. Real-time when available. But understand: if you go into Algeria, you go dark. No extraction. No backup. You're on your own operationally."

"Understood."

Within hours, imagery arrives.

Port of Algiers. Fishing vessels. Smuggling routes. Known safe buildings.

Moreau correlates it with signal intercepts. Cellular hits. Brief bursts of encrypted traffic.

Nothing definitive.

Yasmine is small in a city of three million.

She doesn't use phones much.

She doesn't use cards.

She doesn't need to.

Hiding is easy when you are disciplined.

Thomas needs a mistake.

He gets one from money.

De Vergennes finds a transfer.

Not bitcoin.

Cash pickup.

A courier in Marseille delivered euros to a man who wired dinars in Algiers.

Old system.

Hawala.

Islamic trust banking. No records. No digital trails. Just names and codes.

One code repeats.

TADR.

Thomas stares at it.

"Tadr?" he says.

"Could be Tadrart," De Vergennes says. "Remote village. Algerian south. Sahara edge."

"Could be a surname," Moreau adds.

Thomas doesn't guess.

He verifies.

He calls the Maghreb desk in Paris. Asks for a list of Hassan's known contacts. Financial networks. Safe houses.

Tadrart comes back.

Remote.

Desert.

A place where governments fade.

A place where Touaregs decide who passes.

A place where French law doesn't reach.

Thomas circles it on the map.

Not a target yet.

A hypothesis.

But it's the first real shape of Yasmine's end.

"Run satellite coverage over Tadrart," Thomas tells Moreau. "I want to see that village. Every building. Every person."

"On it."

Meanwhile Malik is solid.

Zug is clear.

Address identified. Seestrasse 47. Lake view. Underground parking.

Routine mapped. Gym. Groceries. Lake bench. Predictable.

Party schedule known. Friday nights. Girls. Alcohol. Loud.

Thomas looks at the board.

Three targets are gone.

Two remain.

He can't reach Yasmine without intelligence.

He can reach Malik now.

Malik has money.

And Malik has documents.

Financiers write things down.

Insurance.

Backup plans.

Proof of value.

Thomas decides.

"We go to Switzerland," he says.

Beaumont looks up from his laptop.

"When?"

"Tomorrow. You, me, Tarkovsky, Leclerc, De Vergennes, Richelieu. Full team. We hit Malik. We take the safe. We extract everything."

"And if there's nothing?"

"There's always something. Malik is careful. Careful people keep records."

No speeches.

No drama.

Just movement.

The net tightens.

The Mediterranean shrinks.

From five targets to two.

From scattered chaos to focused precision.

Thomas stands at the window. Looks at the harbor. Boats moving in and out. Normal life.

But this isn't normal life.

This is the endgame.

Malik first. Then Yasmine.

Money, then the martyr.

The order matters.

Malik has information. Coordinates. Contact lists. Financial records.

Everything Thomas needs to find Yasmine.

"Pack light," Thomas says. "Switzerland is quiet. We stay quiet. In and out. No trace."

The operators nod.

They've done this before.

Different countries. Different targets. Same method.

Clean. Professional. Final.

Thomas returns to the map.

Red X over Palermo. Tunis. Lisbon.

Red circle over Zug.

Red question mark over Tadrart.

The net is tightening.

The cell is dying.

And Yasmine, sitting in a stone house in the Sahara, doesn't know her time is running out.

She thinks distance saved her.

It didn't.

It just gave Thomas time to prepare.

And preparation is what kills.

The next step is Zug.
