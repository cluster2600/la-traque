# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 3: LA BOUCHERIE (REVISED)

The tunnel mouth is black. The probe lights cut through but they don't reach far. Just ten meters ahead. Then darkness swallows everything. Thomas walks slowly. The team behind him follows. Four firefighters. Two medics. Two structural engineers. Everyone breathing heavy. Everyone trying not to think about the weight of Paris above them.

The first body is twenty meters in.

A woman. Age maybe thirty. Crushed. The blast wave compressed her against the metal wall. Dead. Thomas doesn't stop to check for pulse. There's no pulse. The structural engineer checks the wall. Nods. It's still stable. For now.

They move deeper.

The smell hits next. Blood. Burning. Flesh. Metal. The smell of what happens when a shaped charge detonates in an enclosed space with three hundred human bodies. The smell of death compressed into a single moment.

The tunnel opens into the first car.

It's impossible. The car is twisted but still intact. The doors are blown outward. The windows are gone. Inside is darkness and wreckage and bodies and people. Some still alive. Many not.

The scale is beyond comprehension. Bodies stacked. Bodies crushed. Bodies burned. Bodies impaled on metal that was seats minutes ago. Bodies still in the process of dying. Some screaming. Some silent. Some trying to help others. Some too shocked to move.

Captain Lenoir is already inside. Police. He's been working for ten minutes. He's counted what he can count. His face is white.

"At least one hundred fifty dead," he says. His voice is flat. Shock. "Possibly more. I can't move through the wreckage. I don't know how many are underneath. The second car is worse. The blast was more direct. I'd estimate two hundred dead in that car. Maybe more."

Three hundred fifty. Maybe four hundred.

Thomas doesn't respond. He moves deeper into the first car.

The teenage girl from the second car is here. She was between the cars when the blast happened. She's alive but her legs are crushed under a seat. She's conscious. She's filming on her phone. Documenting the horror. When she sees Thomas, she stops filming.

"Are we getting out?" she asks. The question is simple. The answer is no. But Thomas says yes.

"Yes. We're getting you out."

He doesn't know if he's lying.

Captain Moreau of the Paris Fire Brigade is assessing the second car. He climbs through the wreckage. His face gets darker with every meter.

He comes back.

"Structural integrity is failing," Moreau says. "The blast damaged load-bearing columns. The tunnel is collapsing. Slow. But it's collapsing. We have maybe one hour before the ceiling comes down."

"Can we move the train cars?" Thomas asks.

"The backward car is still in the tunnel. The weight is pressing down. We move it, we risk immediate collapse. We don't move it, we have one hour. Either way, we lose."

Thomas thinks about this. One hour to evacuate three hundred fifty bodies. Some alive. Some dead. Some too badly injured to move.

"We move it anyway," Thomas says. "Slowly. One meter per minute. The weight decreases. The timeline extends."

"If you're wrong, everyone dies," Moreau says.

"If we don't move it, everyone dies anyway," Thomas says. "At least this way, we try."

Moreau nods. He understands. He calls his superior.

The conversation is short.

"Start moving the backward car," Moreau tells the dispatcher. "Slowly. One meter per minute. The tunnel is unstable. Yes. Full evacuation mode. I'll send you the casualty count in sixty seconds."

He looks at Thomas.

"Three hundred fifty?" Thomas says.

"At least."

Moreau gives the number to the dispatcher. There's a pause on the other end. Then: "Stand by. We're escalating to national emergency protocols."

---

The evacuation takes four hours.

The backward car is moved backward in small increments. Each meter takes three minutes. The pressure on the tunnel decreases. The ceiling stops moving. The limestone stops crying.

Thomas coordinates from inside the first car. He walks through the wreckage. He steps on bodies. He steps around bodies. He steps over bodies. He's cataloging. The living. The dead. The dying. The order of evacuation.

Children first. Then elderly. Then the most critically injured. Then everyone else.

The firefighters are working like machines. No emotion. Just work. Move this body. Check this pulse. Stabilize this person. Carry this person. Another person. Another. Another.

The medics are overwhelmed. Triage becomes impossible. They're just trying to move people out of the tunnel before it collapses.

By hour two, one hundred people are out.

By hour three, two hundred and fifty are out.

By hour four, all one hundred fifty from the first car are out. All two hundred from the second car are out. Only the dead remain.

One hundred bodies left in the tunnel. Maybe more. Maybe fewer. Nobody's counting anymore.

Thomas is the last person out of the first car.

He walks through the wreckage one more time. Looking for anyone alive. Finding nobody. Just bodies waiting for the forensics teams to collect them.

He exits the tunnel at 10:17 AM.

The air is cold. The sky is gray. Paris is watching.

The casualty count is still climbing. Three hundred twenty-seven dead confirmed. One hundred forty-three injured. Numbers that will change. Numbers that will grow.

Moreau is sitting on the ground. Exhausted. He looks up at Thomas.

"We saved them," he says. "The ones we could save."

"Yes," Thomas says.

"We left the others."

"Yes."

"I'll remember this," Moreau says. "For the rest of my life, I'll remember stepping over bodies. I'll remember the ones I couldn't reach. I'll remember the screaming."

Thomas sits down next to him.

"That's the job," Thomas says. "That's what we do. We save who we can. We leave the rest to someone else to count."

---

By noon, the decision is made.

Martial law. The government is activating emergency protocols. The Métro is shut down across all lines. The army is mobilizing. CRS units are being deployed to Mantes-la-Jolie where the safe house is located. The city is being locked down.

France is at war with itself.

**END CHAPTER 3 (REVISED)**

**Key changes:**
- Scale: 150+ dead in first car, 200 in second car (total ~350+)
- Multiple bodies, impossible triage, evacuation of 350 people over 4 hours
- Timeline: Extended because backward train is moved (one hour becomes four hours)
- Moreau's shock and trauma (he'll remember this forever)
- Thomas's perspective: clinical, compartmented, professional
- Ending: Martial law declaration, army mobilization, CRS sent to Mantes-la-Jolie
- Tone: Horror, scale, human cost
