# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 34: ZUG ASSASSINATION

Malik Benhadj never left Switzerland.

He thought he was safe. He thought hiding in Zug, in a house on the lake, meant invisibility. He thought cryptocurrency and darkness meant survival.

He was wrong.

The bitcoin transactions they found in the Mantes-la-Jolie TNT lab led directly to him. Wallet addresses. Transaction IDs. Blockchain traces. All pointed to Zug. All pointed to a house. All pointed to a man who thought he could disappear into Swiss wealth and cryptocurrency anonymity.

Thomas's team watched him for three days.

The house was on the lake. A modern house. Clean lines. Expensive. The kind of place where rich men hide their secrets. There was a ponton. A wooden dock. Lake access. Private. Isolated. Perfect for what they had planned.

The evening of the operation, Malik hosted a party.

Girls arrived. Slavic accents. Dark hair. Professional smiles. They understood the transaction. They understood the money. They understood not to ask questions.

Men arrived too. Four of them. Including Malik.

Three men of Arab origin. Associates. Business partners. Money men. Not involved with explosives. Innocent bystanders.

One girl was between two of the men. The space between them. The inevitability of what was happening. The transaction of flesh and survival.

Malik was fat. Heavy. His skin glistened with baby oil. He moved slowly. He moved deliberately. He was a man used to comfort and excess.

The Swiss secret service didn't know Thomas's team was in Zug.

They didn't know that a French DGSE operation was happening on Swiss soil. They didn't know that authorization had been given. They didn't know that the Director had made arrangements. They didn't know anything.

Two members of Thomas's team were on the street side. Beaumont and Richelieu. Watching the front of the house. Watching the road. Watching for police. Watching for intervention. Ready to create distraction if needed.

Four members went in through the lake side.

Thomas. Tarkovsky. De Vergennes. Leclerc.

The ponton was dark. The water was dark. The house was lit from inside. They could see the party. They could see the movement. They could see the excess.

They entered through the sliding doors. The ones that faced the lake. The ones Malik thought were secure because no one would come from the water.

They were professionals. They moved silently. They moved with purpose. They moved without hesitation.

The scene inside was exactly as expected.

Three Slavic girls. Mostly undressed. Mostly complicit. Mostly terrified when armed men appeared.

Four men. Three Arab, one fat European. All naked or nearly so. All caught mid-transaction. All suddenly aware that their safety was an illusion.

Malik saw them first. He understood immediately. Understanding came to his face. The realization that the money didn't protect him. That Zug didn't protect him. That Switzerland didn't protect him.

Thomas nodded.

Tarkovsky moved toward the Arab men. Weapon drawn. Suppressed. He didn't fire. He didn't need to. The men understood. They froze. They stood with hands up. They understood that resistance meant death.

De Vergennes moved toward the girls. He didn't threaten them. He simply gestured. Away. Out. Gone. The girls moved. They grabbed clothes. They ran toward the kitchen and out. They understood survival meant not being there.

The Arab men didn't move. They stood naked in the living room. They waited. They understood that moving meant death.

Malik tried to run.

Leclerc caught him. The medic. The young one. Malik was heavy. Malik was slick with baby oil. Malik was difficult to hold. But Leclerc held him anyway. The medical training translated to body awareness. To leverage. To control. To moving a heavy, unwilling body.

Before they took him to the lake, they searched the house.

Malik's bedroom. The safe in the closet. De Vergennes opened it with explosives. Professional. Quiet. Efficient.

Inside: everything.

Gold bars. Stacks of them. 10 kilograms each. Dozens of them. Professional storage. Untraceable wealth. Millions in gold alone.

Diamonds. In velvet boxes. Loose stones. Professional cuts. Certified. Worth more than the gold. Millions more.

US Treasury bonds. Bearer bonds. No names. No registration. No trace. Direct to whoever held them. Worth tens of millions. The ultimate untraceable currency.

Cash. One thousand franc notes. Stacks and stacks. Hundreds of thousands. Maybe a million in Swiss currency.

Watches. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre. Tens of thousands of francs each. Hidden in velvet cases.

Documents. Papers. Folios. In the back of the safe. Names. Locations. Details. About Tadrart. About Hassan's house. About the refuge. About everything they needed to know. Valuable but insignificant compared to the rest.

Thomas looked at De Vergennes.

"Take it," Thomas said.

"All of it?" De Vergennes asked.

"All of it."

The team packed everything. Gold into bags. Diamonds into pockets. Treasury bonds into secure compartments. Cash into duffels. Watches into cases. Documents into portfolios. Tadrart intelligence into Thomas's hands.

Fifty million Swiss francs equivalent. Maybe more. Professional money laundering on an epic scale. A decade of financial operations. All in one safe.

Leclerc looked at Thomas. Medical officer. Young. Professional.

"For what?" Leclerc asked.

"Retirement," Thomas said.

They understood. They understood that this was off-books. They understood that this was not official. They understood that fifty million francs, distributed among six operators, meant generational wealth. Meant never working again. Meant security for life and their families' lives. They understood that this was the price of silence. This was the reward for professionalism. This was the compensation for risk.

This was payment for becoming ghosts.

They took it all.

They took him to the lake.

The ponton. The dark water. The Swiss night.

Thomas held Malik's head. Leclerc held his arms. Tarkovsky held his legs. De Vergennes watched for lights. Watched for movement. Watched for rescue that wouldn't come.

Malik tried to scream. Thomas's hand covered his mouth. The sound was muffled. The struggle was brief. The outcome was inevitable.

They pushed him into the water.

He sank at first. His body, heavy with fat and baby oil, wanted to sink. But then the buoyancy caught him. The fat kept him afloat. His body surfaced. His lungs worked. He coughed water. He tried to breathe. He tried to stay alive.

Thomas watched him from the ponton.

"Don't let him swim," Thomas said.

Leclerc understood. He'd trained for water rescue. He knew how to keep someone afloat. He knew how to keep someone alive in water.

He also knew how to keep someone from reaching shore.

Malik thrashed. His heavy body created waves. His arms flailed. His baby oil made him slippery. He tried to reach the ponton. He tried to reach safety. He failed. The oil made him impossible to grip. The weight made him impossible to move fast. The panic made him ineffective.

It took longer than expected.

Drowning a heavy man is not quick. Drowning a man covered in baby oil is not easy. Drowning a man who understands he's going to die is not efficient.

But eventually, it ends.

Malik's movements slowed. His gasps became gurgles. His struggling became stillness. His body floated. The baby oil kept him on the surface. Dead weight. Literal weight. Sinking and floating and sinking again.

Thomas watched without expression.

"Leave him," Thomas said.

The body would be found eventually. The body would raise questions. The body would be a problem for the Swiss authorities. The body floating in the lake would be evidence of something. Something they couldn't solve. Something they couldn't blame on anyone. A financier. A criminal. A man involved with explosives. A man with no identity to protect him. A man with no country to claim him.

They left him there.

The team extracted through the lake. Back to the boats. Back to the dark water. Back to Switzerland's secret that it didn't know about.

The Arab men were still in the living room. Standing naked. Understanding that they could leave. Understanding that living was conditional on silence. Understanding that the next time, they might not be so lucky.

They left eventually. Dressed. Called for the girls. Left the house. Left Zug. Left Switzerland. They understood the message. They understood that business with Malik had consequences. They understood that the French had reach. They understood that silence was survival. Malik financed terrorism. They just moved money. Malik was the target. They were bystanders.

Beaumont and Richelieu reported: clear. No police. No intervention. No complications.

The Swiss secret service never knew.

Thomas and his team extracted to the safe house. To rest. To debrief. To prepare for the final operation.

With fifty million Swiss francs equivalent in gold, diamonds, US Treasury bonds, and cash.

Malik Benhadj was dead.

The bitcoin wallets were frozen. The private keys were lost. The cryptocurrency would disappear into government control. The transaction chain was broken.

But the team had the physical wealth. Fifty million francs. More. Gold. Diamonds. Bearer bonds. Untraceable. Untaxable. Theirs.

Generational wealth. Retirement financed by a dead man's safe. Never work again. Never worry again. Never struggle again.

For the price of one body in a Swiss lake.

And in Tadrart, Yasmine waited. Unaware that her financier had been drowned in a Swiss lake. Unaware that her operation was collapsing. Unaware that the hunt was closing in. Unaware that death was waiting in the Sahara.
