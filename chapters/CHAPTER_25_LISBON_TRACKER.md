# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 25: LISBON TRACKER

Amina arrives in Lisbon on a wet morning.

Rain on cobblestones. Gray Atlantic light. The smell of diesel and fish.

She comes in through Spain.

Bus from Bizerte to Tunis.

Then a forged ferry manifest.

Then Barcelona.

Then another bus.

No flights. No passport booths.

She uses crowds.

Tourists.

Noise.

Portugal feels soft to her.

Not like France.

Not like Tunisia.

A place that doesn't look too hard.

The city sprawls across seven hills. Trams rattle up steep streets. Tile facades crack in the salt air. Graffiti covers old walls. The Tagus River reflects clouded sky.

Lisbon is chaos and beauty. A place where people disappear easily.

She rents a room in Graça. Cash. No contract.

The landlady is old. Doesn't ask questions. Takes the euros and hands over a key.

The room is small. One bed. One window. View of rooftops and laundry lines.

Amina thinks she is invisible.

She finds work cleaning at a hotel in Alfama. Under a different name. Fatima. Common. Forgettable.

The hotel manager barely looks at her. He needs workers. She needs cash. Transaction complete.

She wears a headscarf. Keeps her eyes down. Moves quietly through hallways pushing a cart.

Towels. Sheets. Soap.

Invisible labor.

She thinks she blends.

She doesn't.

Moreau catches the SIM.

A Portuguese number. New handset. Same encrypted app.

Same contact list.

Same habit.

Amina sends one message.

To a number in Algeria.

Four words.

*Je suis en sécurité.*

I'm safe.

Moreau doesn't translate it.

He doesn't need to.

He forwards it to Thomas.

Thomas reads it once.

Then he calls Lisbon.

DGSE liaison reaches Portuguese intelligence in minutes.

Portugal wants to help.

Portugal doesn't want bombs.

Portugal doesn't want French anger.

A man named Silva meets Leclerc and Moreau near Rossio.

The square is full of tourists. Pigeons. Street performers. The fountain sprays water in geometric arcs.

Silva speaks French with a soft accent.

"We have her face," Silva says. "Cameras at the hotel. She works mornings. She lives near Graça."

He hands over a folder. Photographs. Timestamps. Building address.

Leclerc asks the only question that matters.

"Can we do it clean?"

Silva nods.

"Third floor guest room," he says. "No cameras inside. Hall cameras can be down for two hours. Technical maintenance."

Moreau doesn't smile.

"We check in tonight," Leclerc says.

Silva gives them keys.

Not room keys.

A maintenance master key.

And a locker number.

Inside the locker are two suppressed pistols and cleaning supplies.

Portuguese pragmatism.

That night, Leclerc and Moreau check into the hotel separately.

Different identities.

Different check-in times.

Adjacent rooms on the third floor.

They don't speak in the hallway. They don't acknowledge each other.

They are strangers staying in the same hotel.

That's all.

Morning.

07:28.

Lisbon wakes up. Trams clatter. Seagulls cry. The smell of fresh bread drifts from bakeries.

A knock.

"Housekeeping," a voice says.

Amina's voice.

Not Algerian.

Not Tunisian.

French banlieue vowels under a forced softness.

Leclerc opens the door.

Smiles.

"Come in," he says in Portuguese. "I'm going to breakfast."

Amina pushes her cart inside.

She turns.

Sees the gun.

Understands.

Her face goes pale. Her breath stops.

She goes for the hallway.

Leclerc is faster.

Hand over mouth.

Arm around chest.

He drags her into the bathroom.

Tile.

Drain.

Easy.

Amina fights.

Not strong.

But desperate.

Nails clawing. Legs kicking.

She wants to scream. She wants to live.

Leclerc pins her against the tub.

Moreau enters and locks the door.

No words.

They don't argue with terrorists.

They don't negotiate.

Leclerc presses the suppressor to her temple.

Amina stares at him.

She wants to say something.

She wants a speech.

She wants history.

She wants to explain.

Leclerc doesn't give her that.

He fires.

One muffled crack.

Amina collapses.

Dead before her knees hit tile.

Blood spreads slowly across white ceramic.

Moreau checks pulse.

Nothing.

Confirmed.

They work fast.

Plastic sheeting.

Gloves.

Industrial cleaner.

No blood trail.

No hair.

No prints.

They wrap the body.

They move it across the hall into Moreau's bathroom.

Temporary.

Silva's people will handle disposal.

That's the arrangement.

Portuguese Navy. A boat. Deep water. No questions.

By 09:15 the hallway cameras are back.

By 09:30 Leclerc checks out.

By 09:45 Moreau checks out.

Two tourists leaving early.

Normal.

The hotel manager waves goodbye. Doesn't notice anything. Room 312 will be cleaned later. By someone else.

At the airport they separate.

Different flights.

Different routes.

Back to Marseille.

Thomas gets the confirmation at 16:02.

"Target eliminated," Leclerc says. "Clean. Portuguese cooperation. No exposure."

Thomas marks Portugal with a red X.

Amina ran from Tunisia to Portugal.

It bought her weeks.

Maybe days.

It didn't buy her survival.

Thomas looks at the board.

Hassan Jr. is gone.

Amina is gone.

Leila is a name crossed off in another file.

Only two dots remain.

Zug.

Algeria.

Money.

And a girl in a stone house.

Thomas turns away from the board.

Outside, Marseille burns in afternoon sun. The harbor shimmers. Boats rock gently.

The city doesn't care about justice. It never does.

But Thomas does.

"We go to Switzerland," he says.

The hunt keeps moving.

West to east.

Target to target.

Elimination to elimination.

And somewhere in the Sahara, Yasmine sits by a window. She doesn't know Amina is dead. She doesn't know the net is tightening.

She thinks she has time.

She doesn't.
