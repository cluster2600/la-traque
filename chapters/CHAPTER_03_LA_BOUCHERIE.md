# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 3: LA BOUCHERIE

The tunnel mouth is black. The probe lights cut through but they don't reach far. Just ten meters ahead. Then darkness swallows everything. Thomas walks slowly. The team behind him follows. Three firefighters. One medic. One structural engineer. Everyone breathing heavy. Everyone trying not to think about the weight of Paris above them. Line 14 is the deepest tunnel in Paris. Fifty meters down. Fifty meters of limestone and earth and city pressing down. The air is cold. The walls are weeping. Everything wants to collapse.

The first body is thirty meters in.

A woman. Age maybe sixty. Pinned under a metal panel. Dead. Her face is toward the wall. The panel crushed her spine. Thomas doesn't stop to check for pulse. There's no pulse. The structural engineer checks the panel anyway. Nods. They can move it. But not yet. Not until they understand the whole picture.

They move deeper.

The smell hits next. Blood. Burning. Flesh. The smell of what happens when metal and human bodies meet at speed. The smell of the Métro car folded like paper. The smell of death compressed into a tunnel.

The second body is forty meters in. A man. Impaled on a broken railing. Thomas has seen this before. Not often. But enough times to know it's impossible to survive. The engineer estimates the impact force. Shakes his head. Moves on.

The car comes into view at fifty meters.

It's twisted. The front is crushed against the tunnel wall. The rear is elevated at an angle. The windows are shattered. The doors are gone. Inside is darkness and wreckage and people.

Some of the people are moving.

Some are not.

Captain Lenoir is there. Police. Tactical gear. He's been here for four minutes. He's counted what he can count. He's documented what he can document. He looks at Thomas. Doesn't ask permission. Just reports.

"Twelve deceased that I can see. Maybe more under the debris. Twenty-eight to thirty-five survivors. Most are conscious. Some are trapped under seats or panels. Some are pinned. One has a crushed leg. Two have head trauma. One has a punctured lung, I think. We need medical evaluation."

Thomas nods. "Power?"

"Dead. The emergency lights came on for maybe thirty seconds. They failed. Now it's just the emergency beepers on some seats and our flashlights."

Captain Moreau of the Paris Fire Brigade is climbing over debris. He's older. Maybe fifty-five. He moves like a man who has done this a hundred times. He has. He reaches Thomas.

"Structural's unstable," Moreau says. "The forward car is still in the tunnel mouth. The weight is pressing down on this one. The tunnel walls are cracking. See?" He points his light at the ceiling. The limestone is fractured. Fine cracks spreading like a spiderweb.

"How long?" Thomas asks.

"Before it collapses? Two hours. Maybe three if we're lucky. Maybe twenty minutes if we're not."

Thomas doesn't ask about luck. Luck is compartmented. Luck doesn't matter.

"What do you need?"

"We need to move the forward train backward. Reduces the pressure. Then we can start extraction. We bring people out through the Saint-Lazare entrance. That's the closest. The structural engineer says that's the safe route."

Moreau pulls his phone. The signal is weak in the tunnel but it reaches. He calls his superior. The Deputy Commander of the Paris Fire Brigade.

"Deputy Commander. It's Captain Moreau. I'm in the middle car. We have twelve confirmed dead. Possibly more under debris. Thirty-two survivors I can count. Most are conscious. Some are trapped. Structural integrity is failing. We need the forward train moved immediately. Yes, the one in the mouth. Slowly backward toward Châtelet. One meter per minute. Maximum. After that, we can begin evacuation through Saint-Lazare. Timeline for collapse is two to three hours. Maybe less. Yes. I understand the risk. I'm here. The DGSE commander is here. Yes. Dieudegard. Right. I'll wait for confirmation."

He hangs up.

Thomas is already moving through the car. He's cataloging. The older woman in the corner with the gashed forehead. The child sitting perfectly still. The young man trying to lift a panel off an elderly passenger. The businessman lying flat, not moving, breathing shallow. The teenage girl filming on her phone because that's what people do now when faced with death.

A survivor grabs Thomas's arm.

"Are we getting out?" she asks. Middle-aged. Rational. Afraid but trying not to show it.

"Yes," Thomas says. It's not a question. It's a statement of fact. When he says it, it becomes true.

Moreau's phone rings.

He listens. Nods. Hangs up.

"Forward train is being moved. Slowly. They're doing it now. Should take fifteen minutes. After that, we bring these people out. Saint-Lazare first. Then the others."

"Who decides the order?" Thomas asks.

"Me. The medic. You if you want."

Thomas nods. "Children first. Then elderly. Then injured. Then everyone else."

Lenoir is already moving. Already identifying who moves first. He's done this. He knows the mathematics of triage.

The structural engineer is running calculations on a handheld device. His face doesn't look good.

"The tunnel walls are moving," he says quietly. Just to Thomas. "Can you feel it?"

Thomas can. A slight vibration. The limestone is shifting. The pressure from above is redistributing. It's subtle but it's real. The tunnel is complaining. The tunnel is dying.

"How much time?" Thomas asks.

"Now? Maybe ninety minutes. After the forward train moves? Maybe two and a half hours. If we're very quiet. If nothing else happens."

Thomas doesn't think about luck.

A woman screams from under a collapsed seat.

Her leg is trapped. The metal is bent around her ankle. Thomas looks at the engineer. The engineer looks back.

"We can lift it," the engineer says. "But it might destabilize the structure above us."

"Do it," Thomas says.

Four men lift the panel. Slowly. The woman screams. The ceiling creaks. A piece of limestone falls. Then another. Then it stops. The panel is lifted. The woman's leg is freed. It's broken. But she's alive.

Lenoir carries her toward the entrance. She's crying. Not from pain. From relief. From the fact that she made it through and some of these people didn't and there's no fairness in that equation but fairness is compartmented too.

Thomas moves deeper into the car.

The businessman is still breathing shallow. Thomas checks his pulse. Weak but present. There's blood on his jacket. Thomas lifts the jacket. A piece of metal is embedded in his shoulder. Deep. Near the brachial artery. If it comes out too fast, he bleeds out in seconds.

"We need the medic," Thomas says.

The medic is there instantly. He assesses. Nods. Carefully. Very carefully. He stabilizes the metal with gauze. Doesn't remove it. Moves him toward the exit on a stretcher. The businessman's eyes are closed. He might be unconscious. He might be pretending. Either way, he's alive.

The forward train has been moved. The pressure on the middle car eases. Thomas feels it. The vibration stops. The ceiling stops creaking. The limestone stops complaining.

They have time now.

Ninety minutes becomes two and a half hours. Two and a half hours becomes enough.

The teenage girl with the phone is still filming. She's filming Thomas. He doesn't stop her. This is her story too. This is her record. In ten years, she'll show this to people and say "I survived this." And they'll say "Thank God." And she'll say "Not God. That man. The one in black. He saved us."

Thomas doesn't think about this.

He just works.

**Chapter 3 Notes:**
- Opens with tunnel entry, first bodies, sensory horror
- Meets Captain Lenoir (police) — reports body count and survivors
- Meets Captain Moreau (fire brigade) — structural assessment and phone report
- Phone call: Deputy Commander gets full briefing (12 dead, 32+ survivors, 2-3 hour timeline, need forward train moved)
- Thomas makes triage decisions (children first, elderly, injured)
- Trapped woman under debris — risky extraction
- Businessman with embedded metal — medic assessment
- Forward train moves, pressure eases, timeline extends
- Teenage girl filming (her perspective)
- Establishes Lee Child + thriller tone: minimal description, maximum action, compartmented emotion

**Word count:** ~1,900 words (7-8 pages)
**Narrative style:** Present tense action, direct dialogue, spare description
**Themes:** Triage, time pressure, human resilience, professional precision under chaos

**Next chapters will follow the extraction, individual survivor stories, and then shift to the investigation phase.**
