# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 1: RUE DES ROSIERS

The phone rings at 6:12 AM.

Not his personal phone. His work phone. The encrypted one. The one that only rings when something is wrong.

Thomas has been awake for twenty minutes. Lying in the dark. Ceiling is white. Radiator ticks. Paris is still sleeping. He doesn't reach for the phone immediately. He waits. Listening. Understanding. Then he answers.

"Dieudegard."

"It's Moreau. We have a situation."

Thomas doesn't ask questions yet. He waits. This is how it works. Moreau talks. Thomas listens. Then Thomas moves.

"Métro Line 14. Between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare. Multiple explosions reported. Two separate train cars. First reports came in four minutes ago."

Thomas sets down the phone on speaker. He's already getting out of bed. Cold floor. Bare feet. The apartment is small. One bedroom. Living room. Kitchen. Bathroom. Everything minimal. Everything necessary. Nothing excess.

"How many casualties?" Thomas asks, moving to the closet.

"Unknown. Early estimates. The cars were packed. Morning commute. Heavy passenger load. Both cars are dark. No communication from either one. Emergency services are mobilizing."

"How many passengers?" Thomas asks.

"Estimates between one hundred fifty and three hundred per car."

Three hundred. Per car. Two cars.

He pulls on black tactical pants. Black shirt. Boots. The clothes he keeps ready. Always ready.

"I'm moving. I'll be there in twelve minutes."

"We need you coordinating from the command center. Not on-site."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's already heading out the door. He grabs the keys to the MV Agusta Brutale. Four cylinders. Dark metal. Italian precision. The bike is waiting in the courtyard. Always ready.

Not his personal phone. His work phone. The encrypted one. The one that only rings when something is wrong.

"Dieudegard."

"It's Moreau. We have a situation."

Thomas doesn't ask questions yet. He waits. This is how it works. Moreau talks. Thomas listens. Then Thomas moves.

"Métro Line 14. Between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare. Multiple explosions reported. Two separate train cars. First reports came in four minutes ago."

Thomas sets down the espresso. It steams on the table. Untouched.

"How many casualties?"

"Unknown. Early estimates. The cars were packed. Morning commute. Heavy passenger load. Both cars are dark. No communication from either one. Emergency services are mobilizing."

"How many passengers?" Thomas asks.

"Estimates between one hundred fifty and three hundred per car."

Three hundred. Per car. Two cars.

"I'm moving. I'll be there in twelve minutes."

"We need you coordinating from the command center. Not on-site."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's already moving. He sets down the phone on speaker and walks to the bedroom. Opens the closet. Black tactical pants. Black shirt. Boots. The clothes he keeps ready. Always ready.

**FLASHBACK**

July 25, 1995. 4:45 PM.

Thomas is sixteen years old. He's at a café in the 5th arrondissement. With other friends from summer. A group of them had met at a colony de vacances. Summer camp. They'd promised to meet in Paris after the vacation ended. One last time together before life separated them.

Jérôme was supposed to be there. He was late. Very late. By 4:55 PM, he called Thomas's parents' apartment. Thomas answered. Jérôme's voice was rushed.

"I'm sorry. I'm late. My parents wanted to talk. Can we meet somewhere else? Somewhere closer?"

"Where?" Thomas asked.

"Saint-Michel. I'm calling from home. I can be there in ten minutes. At the Métro entrance. Okay?"

Thomas said okay.

Jérôme was sixteen. He was always late. He always apologized. He always had reasons. But he always showed up.

Thomas told the others. Said he'd go meet Jérôme. He'd catch up with them later. The others said fine. They stayed at the café.

Thomas waited. The others chatted. Time passed. Five more minutes. Ten more minutes.

Around 5:15 PM, Thomas's parents called. They wanted to know where he was. He told them he was at the café with friends. They said to stay put. They were coming to get him.

The television was on in the café. Some news program. Then the interruption. Breaking news. An explosion. The Métro. Saint-Michel station. The RER B. Multiple casualties.

Thomas didn't move for three minutes.

Then he called his parents.

They told him to stay put. They were coming to get him.

The phone lines jammed. The reports kept coming. Eight dead. One hundred fifty injured. No names yet. Bodies being removed from the wreckage.

Thomas sat in the café and waited.

Around midnight, a police officer approached him. Asking if he knew anyone on the train. Thomas said his friend was supposed to be there. Jérôme. He gave his name. The officer took notes.

The next morning, his parents brought him to the police station. They asked him to identify the body. But identification was complicated. The bomb had been under a strapontin. A fold-down seat. Jérôme had been sitting on it. The blast was direct. The body was difficult to identify visually.

They used dental records. Dental records took two days.

Two days of not knowing. Two days of hoping. Two days of the mathematics being impossible.

On day three, it was confirmed. Jérôme was dead. One of eight. Sitting on a strapontin. Waiting for Thomas. Thomas was safe. At the café. With the others. Waiting for Jérôme to show up.

Jérôme was late by five minutes. He took a train that had a bomb on it. He sat on a seat that was directly above the bomb. The bomb detonated. The mathematics of death are impossible.

Thomas was sixteen when he learned that sometimes being late kills you. Sometimes being on time saves you. Sometimes there's no pattern. Sometimes it's just chance.

Sometimes it's the worst kind of randomness. A friend decides to catch up. Takes one train instead of another. Sits in one seat instead of standing. And dies.

Twenty-three years later, he hasn't forgotten. He's still not sure if it was luck or curse that Jérôme was the one who died, not him.

---

Thomas is in the car now. Driving fast through empty Paris streets. The radio is on. The news keeps talking. Métro 14. Two explosions. Multiple trains. Hundreds of casualties. Numbers are climbing. The reports are fragmenting. Nobody knows how many are dead.

Thomas knows it's bad.

He arrives at the command center at 6:26 AM.

The chaos is organized but barely. Police. Fire brigade. Army liaisons. Medical personnel. Everyone trying to process what's happening.

Two bombs. Two train cars. Hundreds of people trapped in darkness. And Thomas has to find who did this and stop them before the third bomb detonates.

Because there's always a third bomb.

Always.
