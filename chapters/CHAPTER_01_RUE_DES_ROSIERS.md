# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 1: RUE DES ROSIERS

The phone rings at 6:12 AM.

Not his personal phone. His work phone. The encrypted one. The one that only rings when something is wrong.

Thomas has been awake for twenty minutes. Lying in the dark. Ceiling is white. Radiator ticks. Paris is still sleeping. He doesn't reach for the phone immediately. He waits. Listening. Understanding. Then he answers.

"Dieudegard."

"It's Moreau. We have a situation."

Thomas doesn't ask questions yet. He waits. This is how it works. Moreau talks. Thomas listens. Then Thomas moves.

"Métro Line 14. Between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare. Multiple explosions reported. Two separate train cars. First reports came in four minutes ago."

Thomas sets down the phone on speaker. He's already getting out of bed. Cold floor. Bare feet. The apartment is small. One bedroom. Living room. Kitchen. Bathroom. Everything minimal. Everything necessary. Nothing excess. He bought it in 2000. Twenty-three years ago. Five years after Jérôme died. The apartment has been his anchor ever since. Precision. Order. Control.

"How many casualties?" Thomas asks, moving to the closet.

"Unknown. Early estimates. The cars were packed. Morning commute. Heavy passenger load. Both cars are dark. No communication from either one. Emergency services are mobilizing."

"How many passengers?" Thomas asks.

"Estimates between one hundred fifty and three hundred per car."

Three hundred. Per car. Two cars.

He pulls on black tactical pants. Black shirt. Boots. The clothes he keeps ready. Always ready.

"I'm moving. I'll be there in twelve minutes."

"We need you coordinating from the command center. Not on-site."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's already heading out the door. He grabs the keys to the MV Agusta Brutale. Four cylinders. Dark metal. Italian precision. The bike is parked in the courtyard below. Always ready.

He moves down the stairs. Fast. The Brutale is waiting. He kicks the engine alive. The sound echoes in the courtyard. 6:14 AM. Empty Paris. He opens the throttle and moves toward the Métro.

**FLASHBACK**

July 25, 1995. 4:45 PM.

Thomas is sixteen years old. He's at a café in the 5th arrondissement. With other friends from summer. A group of them had met at a colony de vacances. Summer camp. They'd promised to meet in Paris after the vacation ended. One last time together before life separated them.

Jérôme was supposed to be there. He was late. Very late. By 4:55 PM, he called Thomas's parents' apartment (landline). Thomas's mother answered. Jérôme's voice was rushed.

"Tell Thomas I'm running late. I'm sorry. I'll catch him later."

That's all. No rescheduled meeting. No Saint-Michel. Just an apology for being late.

Thomas's mother told Thomas when he called from the café at 5:05 PM to check in.

Thomas said okay. Jérôme was always late. He always apologized. He always had reasons. But he always showed up.

Thomas waited at the café with the others. They talked. They drank. They made plans for the rest of the evening. Around 7:00 PM, Thomas's mother came to pick him up. She wanted him home. They drove back to Normandy that evening.

Thomas arrived home around 9:30 PM.

The next morning, his father came into his room. Early. Before Thomas was awake.

"Jérôme is dead."

That's all his father said.

Thomas didn't understand at first. Didn't understand the tense. Didn't understand the finality.

"What?"

"There was a bombing. The RER B. Yesterday evening. At Saint-Michel. Jérôme was on the train."

Thomas sat up. Slow.

"Why was he on that train?" Thomas asked.

His father didn't have the answer yet.

Later that day, Thomas's mother called Jérôme's mother. Found out. Jérôme had called that afternoon. Said he was running late to meet the friends. Apologized. Then he called back an hour later. Said he was taking the RER B to Saint-Michel to catch up with the group there.

But Thomas had already left. Already gone home to Normandy. Already safe.

Jérôme was on a train that had a bomb under a seat. A fold-down seat called a strapontin. Jérôme was sitting on it. One of eight dead.

Thomas was safe in Normandy when the bomb detonated.

The rest happened over the next weeks. Identification (dental records took days). Funeral (small, quiet). Silence. The kind of silence that comes after a child dies and nobody knows what to say.

Thomas was sixteen when he learned that sometimes being late kills you. Sometimes leaving early saves you. Sometimes there's no pattern. Sometimes it's just chance.

Sometimes it's the worst kind of randomness. A friend decides to catch up. Takes one train instead of not. Sits in one seat instead of standing. And dies.

Thomas was safe in Normandy. Jérôme was dead. The mathematics of death are impossible.

Twenty-three years later, he hasn't forgotten. He's still not sure if it was luck or curse that he left for Normandy before finding out Jérôme was dead.

---

Thomas is on the motorcycle now. Driving fast through empty Paris streets. The radio is on. The news keeps talking. Métro 14. Two explosions. Multiple trains. Hundreds of casualties. Numbers are climbing. The reports are fragmenting. Nobody knows how many are dead.

Thomas knows it's bad.

He arrives at the command center at 6:26 AM.

The chaos is organized but barely. Police. Fire brigade. Army liaisons. Medical personnel. Everyone trying to process what's happening.

Two bombs. Two train cars. Hundreds of people trapped in darkness. And Thomas has to find who did this and stop them before the third bomb detonates.

Because there's always a third bomb.

Always.
