# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 1: RUE DES ROSIERS

Thomas wakes at 5:47 AM.

Before the alarm. Before the light. His eyes open. The radiator ticks. Paris is still sleeping. Cold floor under bare feet. He goes to the kitchen. La Marzocco espresso machine. Black. Italian. Precise. He presses the power button. The machine begins heating. Green light. The heating starts.

Sixty seconds until it's ready.

He moves to the living room. Clears the space. Chest to the floor. He starts the push-ups. One. Two. Three. Each one controlled. Elbows tight. Back straight. No wasted motion. The machine hums in the kitchen. Heating. He counts. Thirty. Forty. Fifty. The rhythm is steady. The breath is measured. Mind is empty. Just the body. Just the movement.

The espresso machine beeps.

Ready.

He stops at seventy-three. Stands. No breath visible. No sweat yet. He moves back to the kitchen. The grinder. Beans go in. The sound fills the small apartment. Grinding. Precise. He measures the portafilter. Tamps. Even pressure. No air pockets. Just skill. Just discipline. Just order.

The phone rings.

Not his personal phone. His work phone. The encrypted one. The one that only rings when something is wrong.

Thomas doesn't hesitate. He puts it on speaker. The phone sits on the counter. His hands are already moving. Basket into the group head. The pull bar. The extraction starts. Black liquid flows.

"Dieudegard."

"It's Moreau. We have a situation."

The espresso fills the cup. Slow and even. The crema rises.

"Métro Line 14. Between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare. Multiple explosions reported. Two separate train cars. First reports came in four minutes ago."

Thomas doesn't stop. The first shot is done. Cup in hand. He raises it. He drinks. Slow. The coffee is perfect. Hot. Bitter. Exactly right.

"How many casualties?" Thomas asks.

"Unknown. Early estimates. The cars were packed. Morning commute. Heavy passenger load. Both cars are dark. No communication from either one. Emergency services are mobilizing."

"How many passengers?"

"Estimates between one hundred fifty and three hundred per car."

Thomas sets down the empty cup. Three hundred. Per car. Two cars. The mathematics are immediate. He moves to the closet while Moreau talks.

"I'm moving. I'll be there in twelve minutes."

"We need you coordinating from the command center. Not on-site."

Thomas pulls on black tactical pants. Black shirt. Boots. The clothes he keeps ready. Always ready. He doesn't respond. Response isn't necessary. He grabs the keys to the MV Agusta Brutale. Four cylinders. Dark metal. Italian precision. The bike is parked in the courtyard below. Always ready.

He moves down the stairs. Fast. The Brutale is waiting. He kicks the engine alive. The sound echoes in the courtyard. 6:14 AM. Empty Paris. He opens the throttle and moves toward the Métro.

**FLASHBACK**

July 25, 1995. 4:45 PM.

Thomas is sixteen years old. He's at a café in the 5th arrondissement. With other friends from summer. A group of them had met at a colony de vacances. Summer camp. They'd promised to meet in Paris after the vacation ended. One last time together before life separated them.

Jérôme was supposed to be there. He was late. Very late. By 5:00 PM, it was clear he wasn't coming.

Thomas waited. The others waited. By 6:00 PM, they gave up. They made other plans. They'd catch up with Jérôme later. He was always late anyway.

Around 6:30 PM, Thomas left the café. He took the train back to Normandy. Alone. His mother was waiting for him there. The journey took three hours.

Thomas arrived home around 9:30 PM. No calls. No messages. No way to know anything had happened.

The next morning, his father came into his room. Early. Before Thomas was awake.

"Jérôme is dead."

That's all his father said.

Thomas didn't understand at first. Didn't understand the tense. Didn't understand the finality.

"What?"

"There was a bombing. The RER B. Yesterday evening. At Saint-Michel. Jérôme was on the train."

Thomas sat up. Slow.

"Why was he on that train?" Thomas asked.

His father didn't have the answer yet.

Later that day, Thomas's mother called Jérôme's mother. Found out the details. Jérôme had shown up at home late that afternoon. Said he was going to meet the friends in Paris. Took the RER B to Saint-Michel. He was on the 5:17 PM train. One of eight dead.

Thomas had already left Paris. Already driven to Normandy with his mother. Already safe in bed when the bomb detonated.

Jérôme was on a train that had a bomb under a seat. A fold-down seat called a strapontin. Jérôme was sitting on it. One of eight dead.

Thomas was safe in Normandy when the bomb detonated.

The rest happened over the next weeks. Identification (dental records took days). Funeral (small, quiet). Silence. The kind of silence that comes after a child dies and nobody knows what to say.

Thomas was sixteen when he learned that sometimes being late kills you. Sometimes leaving early saves you. Sometimes there's no pattern. Sometimes it's just chance.

Sometimes it's the worst kind of randomness. A friend decides to catch up. Takes one train instead of not. Sits in one seat instead of standing. And dies.

Thomas was safe in Normandy. Jérôme was dead. The mathematics of death are impossible.

Twenty-three years later, he hasn't forgotten. He's still not sure if it was luck or curse that he left for Normandy before finding out Jérôme was dead.

---

Thomas is on the motorcycle now. Driving fast through empty Paris streets. The radio is on. The news keeps talking. Métro 14. Two explosions. Multiple trains. Hundreds of casualties. Numbers are climbing. The reports are fragmenting. Nobody knows how many are dead.

Thomas knows it's bad.

He arrives at the command center at 6:26 AM.

The chaos is organized but barely. Police. Fire brigade. Army liaisons. Medical personnel. Everyone trying to process what's happening.

Two bombs. Two train cars. Hundreds of people trapped in darkness. And Thomas has to find who did this.

That's all. That's enough.
