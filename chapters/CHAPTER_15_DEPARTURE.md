# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 15: DEPARTURE

Évreux Air Base. Northwest of Paris. Military airfield. DGSE operations center.

Thomas arrives at dawn. The Director has arranged everything. Full authorization. Full resources. A Falcon 7X waiting on the tarmac. Government aircraft. No civilians. No questions. No delays.

The Falcon 7X is a sleek jet. Expensive. Fast. Built for long-range missions. Built for executives and military brass who need to move quickly. Built for people who can't afford delays.

Thomas stands on the tarmac. The jet is fueled. The crew is ready. The destination is Marseille. Two hours of flight time. Direct.

He carries nothing except his documents. His DGSE credentials. His authorization letter from the Director. His photograph. His commitment.

The pilot is military. Professional. The kind of pilot who has flown special operations before. The kind who doesn't ask questions about passengers. The kind who just flies.

"We're ready when you are," the pilot says.

Thomas boards. The cabin is small. Comfortable. Six seats. High-end interior. This is not a combat aircraft. This is a command aircraft. This is where important people make important decisions.

Thomas sits alone in the cabin. He looks out the window. Paris in the distance. The city he's leaving. The city that's burning. The city that's confused and afraid and looking for answers.

The engines start. The sound is different from commercial jets. Sharper. More focused. The sound of precision.

The jet moves forward. Slowly at first. Then faster. The runway is clear. No delays. No waiting. Full priority.

The wheels leave the ground.

Thomas watches Paris shrink below. The Louvre pyramid is gone. The plaza is rubble. Even from this height, he can see the scarring. The damage. The consequence of Yasmine's rage.

The jet climbs. Marseille is south. Two hours. By 7 AM, he'll be at the coast. By 8 AM, he'll be at the harbor. By noon, he'll have answers.

Thomas closes his eyes. He thinks about Jérôme. He thinks about the thirty-minute delay. He thinks about the moment he learned his son was dead. He thinks about that moment and every moment since.

Three thousand people dead. And it's still not enough. It will never be enough.

The jet levels off. Cruising altitude. The cabin pressurizes. The air is thin. The sky is clear. Marseille is waiting.

Thomas opens his eyes. He looks at the authorization letter. The Director's signature. Full authority. Full resources. Full mandate to hunt.

By tonight, he'll be at the harbor. By tomorrow, he'll have the first leads. By the week's end, he'll be in Algeria.

By the month's end, he'll be standing in front of Yasmine.

The jet cuts through the sky. South. Toward the Mediterranean. Toward Algeria. Toward the end of something. Either hers or his. Maybe both.

Marseille is waiting. The harbor. The boats. The people who know where she went.

The hunt is moving fast now. The hunt is in the air. The hunt is accelerating toward conclusion.
