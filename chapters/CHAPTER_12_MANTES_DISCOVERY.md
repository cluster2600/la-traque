# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 12: MANTES-LA-JOLIE

Thomas goes to Mantes-la-Jolie first.

Because Yasmine grew up there. Because the cell must have had infrastructure. Because explosives don't manufacture themselves.

The DGSE analysis team found purchase records. Chemical purchases. Hardware. Industrial-grade equipment. Invoices that lead to a warehouse in the 11th arrondissement of Mantes. The analysis was incomplete when Thomas left the command center. But he has the address.

He arrives at 6:00 AM.

The warehouse is on the outskirts. Industrial zone. Abandoned buildings. The kind of place where nobody asks questions.

The door is padlocked. Thomas cuts through it. Inside: the laboratory.

It's still warm. Still smells like chemicals. Still smells like TNT.

Tables with equipment. Beakers. Scales. Thermometers. Instructions written in French on a whiteboard. Formulas. Calculations. Precise measurements. This is where they built the explosives. This is where they turned chemistry into terror.

Scattered around: energy drink cans. Rolling papers. A PS4 controller on the ground. Posters for French rap artists on the walls. This isn't a madrassa. This isn't a training camp. This is where kids from the HLMs built bombs between video games and weed smoke.

Thomas takes photographs. He calls Moreau.

"I found it," Thomas says. "Mantes-la-Jolie. Warehouse in the industrial zone. Full laboratory. Still active. They left in a hurry."

"Stay there," Moreau says. "I'm sending a team."

But the police arrive first.

By 7:00 AM, the local police have cordoned off the warehouse. By 7:30 AM, news crews are there. By 8:00 AM, the word has spread through Mantes-la-Jolie: the terrorists' laboratory was here. In our town. Our neighbors. Our friends.

By 8:30 AM, the riots begin.

The young men of Mantes gather outside the warehouse. Hundreds of them. Thousands. They don't have weapons. They have rage. They have the knowledge that their neighborhood is now a crime scene. That their mothers are suspects. That their brothers are targets.

"Fascists," they chant. "Fascists. Fascists."

The police form lines. Riot gear. Shields. They don't move toward the crowd. Not yet. They're waiting for orders.

Thomas is still inside the warehouse, photographing evidence. He doesn't see the riots beginning. He doesn't see the crowd growing. He doesn't hear the chanting until it's too late.

The police chief arrives. Young. Uncertain. He looks at the crowd. He looks at his officers. He makes a decision.

"Disperse the crowd," he orders. "Use force if necessary."

The police advance. The crowd doesn't retreat. They push back. Rocks start flying. Bottles. A police van is overturned. A fire is set. The riot police begin firing tear gas.

Thomas exits the warehouse. He's coughing. His eyes burning. He sees the chaos. He sees Mantes-la-Jolie tearing itself apart.

By 10:00 AM, the military arrives. Not just police. Actual military. Armored vehicles. Soldiers with weapons. The order has come from above: suppress the riot. By any means necessary.

The crowd fights back. Young men throwing cobblestones. Burning cars. Building barricades. The military doesn't hesitate. They use rubber bullets. They use water cannons. They use psychological warfare: if you don't disperse, we will kill you.

By noon, the riot is ending. Not because the crowd surrendered. Because they couldn't breathe anymore. Because too many people were bleeding. Because the military had shown its willingness to use lethal force.

By 1:00 PM, the arrests begin.

The military doesn't discriminate. Any young man in the area is a suspect. Any man who fits the profile: tall, dark-skinned, Algerian-looking. They're loaded into trucks. They're taken to a temporary detention facility that the government has set up on the outskirts of Mantes.

Shipping containers. Dozens of them. Stacked on top of each other. Each container: a cell. Eight feet by forty feet. Lined with prisoners. No ventilation. No toilets. No water.

By evening, there are five hundred people in the containers.

By midnight, there are a thousand.

By dawn the next day, there are nearly two thousand.

Half of the male population of Mantes-la-Jolie. Detained without charges. Without trials. Without due process. Suspected of being sympathizers. Suspected of knowing about the cell. Suspected of being Algerian.

Thomas walks through the detention facility. He sees the containers. He sees the people inside. He sees mothers outside the containers, screaming at the soldiers, demanding their sons be released.

He sees a young boy, maybe seventeen. Sitting in the corner of a container. Head in his hands. Not moving. Not speaking.

A soldier is leading Thomas through the containers when he points to one.

"That one. Abdelkrim Diallo. Wheelchair. The disabled guy. He's in there."

Thomas stops.

"Abdelkrim Diallo?"

"Yeah. From the wheelchair bombing. DGSE identified him this morning. The failed device under the train car. They found his name on the wheelchair registration. He lives three blocks from here. We picked him up during the sweep."

Thomas moves toward the container. He can see through the gaps in the metal. A man in a wheelchair is sitting alone in the corner. The same man from the failed bomb investigation. The same man whose explosion didn't detonate. The man sitting in the darkness, knowing that his device failed. Knowing that his brothers are bombing the city. Knowing that he is now a prisoner.

Thomas doesn't speak to him. He just watches for a moment. Then he moves on.

"Why are they all detained?" Thomas asks the same soldier.

"Orders," the soldier says. "Sweep the area. Detain anyone who might have information."

"Information about what?"

"The cell. Yasmine Boudjellal. Anyone who might know her. Anyone who might help her."

Thomas nods. He understands the logic. He understands the necessity. And he understands the horror.

In one container, he hears singing. Arabic. A prayer. Men singing together in the darkness. They're not angry. They're not scared. They're singing because singing is the only thing left they can control.

Thomas leaves the detention facility. He drives south. He has what he needs. He has evidence of the laboratory. He has evidence of the cell's sophistication. He has evidence that Yasmine created the worst terrorist attack in French history.

But he also has the image of two thousand men in shipping containers. And he has the knowledge that half of them probably had nothing to do with anything.

He doesn't stop. He keeps driving south. Toward Marseille. Not directly. Not obviously. He takes secondary roads. He avoids checkpoints. He drives like a man who knows how to disappear.

Because the only thing that will stop the madness is to find her and end her.

By evening, Thomas is south of Mantes. By midnight, he's past Lyon. By dawn, he's approaching Marseille.

He knows Yasmine will go to Marseille. The intercepts mentioned it. The safe houses pointed there. The fishing boats leave from Marseille's harbor at night. She'll blend into the chaos of the port city. She'll disappear into the smuggling networks. She'll board a boat and cross the Mediterranean.

Unless Thomas gets there first.

Yasmine is already in Lyon. Waiting for darkness. Waiting for the train to Marseille. Waiting to join the fishing boats heading south.

The hunt has crossed the sea.
