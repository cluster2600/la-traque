# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 19: BLOCKCHAIN

De Vergennes works in the basement of the Marseille safe house.

Three computers. Six monitors. Encrypted connections. Direct access to DGSE's financial intelligence database.

He's hunting money. Specifically, cryptocurrency. Bitcoin. The cell's financial trail.

Thomas stands behind him. Watching. Learning.

"Explain it to me," Thomas says.

De Vergennes points to the first monitor.

"Bitcoin isn't anonymous," De Vergennes says. "People think it is. They're wrong. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger. The blockchain. Everyone can see every transaction. Forever."

"Then why do criminals use it?"

"Because the ledger doesn't show names. It shows wallet addresses. Random strings of letters and numbers. As long as you don't connect your real identity to a wallet address, you're hidden."

"But you can connect them."

"Sometimes. If the person makes mistakes. If they buy bitcoin on an exchange that requires ID. If they transfer bitcoin to a known wallet. If they spend it somewhere that keeps records."

De Vergennes types rapidly. Code scrolls across screens. Data populates. Patterns emerge.

"We found bitcoin wallets in the Mantes-la-Jolie safe house," De Vergennes continues. "Yazmine's apartment. Written on paper. Twelve wallet addresses. Private keys. Everything we needed."

He pulls up a blockchain explorer. Rows of transactions. Dates. Amounts. Wallet addresses.

"These wallets received bitcoin over the last three years," De Vergennes says. "Small amounts. Regular intervals. Donations. From sympathizers. From donors. From people funding jihadist operations."

"How much total?"

"Approximately eighty-five bitcoin. At current exchange rates, that's about two million euros."

Thomas whistles.

"The operation was well-funded."

"Very. And whoever managed the money knew what they were doing. They didn't just hold bitcoin. They moved it. Converted it. Mixed it. Tried to break the trail."

"Tried?"

"They failed."

De Vergennes clicks through transaction chains. Wallet to wallet. Bitcoin to Monero. Monero to Ethereum. Ethereum back to bitcoin. Complex mixing patterns designed to obscure origin.

"This is Malik's work," De Vergennes says. "Professional money laundering. He's using cryptocurrency tumblers. Mixing services. Decentralized exchanges. Everything criminals use to hide financial flows."

"But you can follow it."

"I can follow it. Because he made mistakes."

De Vergennes pulls up another screen. A transaction highlighted in red.

"Here. Twelve days ago. He converted ten bitcoin to Swiss francs. Through a Zurich exchange. The exchange requires ID verification for fiat currency conversions. He used false documents. But the exchange keeps records. IP addresses. Login times. Device fingerprints."

"You have his location?"

"Better. I have his internet service provider. His approximate neighborhood. And his pattern."

De Vergennes shows Thomas a timeline. Transactions over weeks. Regular patterns. Morning logins. Evening conversions. Weekend transfers.

"He works from home," De Vergennes says. "Same IP address. Same login times. He's not moving around. He's stationary. Comfortable. He thinks he's safe."

"Where?"

"Zug, Switzerland. Confirmed. I cross-referenced the IP address with Swiss ISP databases. He's in the city center. Probably an apartment. Near the lake."

"Can you narrow it further?"

"Give me forty-eight hours. I'm tracking his other transactions. Looking for patterns. Online purchases. Food delivery. Anything that requires a physical address."

Thomas nods.

"How much money has he moved?"

"So far? About forty bitcoin. Roughly one million euros. But there's more. I'm seeing deposits into physical gold purchases. Diamond dealers. Luxury watch retailers. He's converting cryptocurrency into physical assets."

"Why?"

"Portability. Security. Bitcoin can be seized if governments control the blockchain. Physical gold can be carried. Hidden. Transported across borders. He's preparing for the long term. Building a nest egg."

"Or preparing to run."

"Maybe both."

Thomas watches the screens. Numbers flowing. Transactions connecting. Money moving through digital space. Malik's financial fingerprint spreading across the blockchain.

"What else can you learn from this?" Thomas asks.

"I can see who else he's connected to," De Vergennes says. "Wallet addresses that received funds from the same sources. Potential associates. Other cell members. Other operations."

De Vergennes pulls up a network graph. Nodes and connections. Wallet addresses linked by transactions.

"This is the financial network," De Vergennes says. "Twelve wallets directly connected to the cell. Forty-three wallets one degree removed. Hundreds of wallets two degrees removed. The entire jihadist funding ecosystem visible in the blockchain."

"Can you freeze the accounts?"

"I can try. But it's complicated. Bitcoin isn't controlled by banks. It's decentralized. I can't call a bank and ask them to freeze funds. I'd need to seize the private keys. The passwords. The access credentials."

"Which Malik has."

"Which Malik has."

Thomas thinks about this. Malik has money. Malik has resources. Malik has the ability to fund operations indefinitely. Unless Thomas stops him.

"When we eliminate Malik," Thomas says, "we take his private keys. We seize his wallets. We take control of the money."

"That's illegal," De Vergennes says.

"Everything we're doing is illegal," Thomas says. "What's your point?"

De Vergennes smiles slightly.

"No point. Just making sure we're clear about the mission parameters."

"We're clear."

De Vergennes turns back to the screens.

"I'll have a precise location by the end of the week," De Vergennes says. "Address. Apartment number. Daily routine. Everything you need for surveillance."

"And the other targets?"

"Moreau is tracking communications. We're intercepting cell phone signals. Email accounts. Encrypted messaging apps. If any of them communicate with each other, we'll know."

"Are they communicating?"

"Not yet. They're maintaining radio silence. Professional. They understand operational security."

Thomas nods. The cell is smart. The cell is disciplined. The cell knows that communication means exposure.

But silence means isolation. And isolation means vulnerability.

"Keep tracking," Thomas says. "I want to know the moment any of them breaks silence. The moment any of them makes contact. The moment any of them makes a mistake."

"You'll know," De Vergennes promises.

Thomas leaves the basement. He goes upstairs. The map is still on the wall. Five red dots. Five targets.

Malik's dot is getting clearer. Zug, Switzerland. City center. Near the lake. Apartment building. An address waiting to be discovered.

The blockchain doesn't lie. The blockchain records everything. The blockchain is a permanent record of Malik's financial crimes. And now it's a map leading Thomas directly to him.

Malik thinks cryptocurrency makes him invisible. Malik thinks blockchain anonymity protects him. Malik thinks Switzerland is safe.

Malik doesn't know that every transaction he makes is another step in the trail. Another clue. Another piece of intelligence pointing directly at his location.

The hunt is accelerating. The technology is working. The financial trail is leading exactly where Thomas needs it to go.

Malik is in Zug. Thomas knows where. Soon Thomas will know exactly where. And then Thomas will come for him.

The blockchain never forgets. The ledger never lies. The money trail always leads somewhere.

And in Zug, Switzerland, Malik Benhadj is waiting at the end of it.
