# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 19: BLOCKCHAIN

De Vergennes sits in the basement of the Marseille safe house.

A secure room. Encrypted communications. A secure phone on the table.

He's waiting for a report. Not doing the work himself. The work is being done elsewhere. By specialists. By a digital forensics team.

Thomas sits across from him.

"How long?" Thomas asks.

"They said twenty-four hours," De Vergennes says. "Maybe forty-eight."

"Can they do it?"

"They're the best we have. DGSE's cyber intelligence unit. They specialize in tracking financial movements through blockchain. Cryptocurrency. Hidden wealth. If anyone can find Malik, they can."

The phone rings.

De Vergennes answers. He listens. He doesn't speak. He just takes notes. Information flows. Data transfers.

"Understood," De Vergennes says finally. "Confirmed. Zug, Switzerland. I'll brief the commander."

He hangs up.

Thomas leans forward.

"They found him?"

"They found him," De Vergennes says. "Malik Benhadj. Located in Zug, Switzerland. They traced his financial movements through the blockchain. Bitcoin transactions. Wallet addresses. Exchange records. A complete picture of his financial operations."

De Vergennes reads from his notes.

"Malik is a wealth manager," De Vergennes says. "Cover business. He manages money for wealthy families. Qatar families. Saudi families. Arab money that needs to disappear. Legitimate front for illegitimate flows."

"How much money?"

"That's where it gets interesting. The cell had eighty-five bitcoin. But that's just their operational funds. Malik's been moving much larger amounts. Family money. Tens of millions. He takes a percentage. Maybe five percent. He uses those percentages to build his own fortress."

"So fifty million francs..."

"Is his personal accumulation from five years of managing dirty money. Qatar families funding operations across North Africa. Malik taking his cut. Building wealth. Legitimate cover with legitimate funding flowing through it. Perfect hiding place."

Thomas nods. He waits.

"Malik used cryptocurrency tumblers," De Vergennes continues, reading from the report. "Mixing services. Decentralized exchanges. Professional money laundering infrastructure. He was trying to hide his movements. But the forensics team followed the trail anyway."

"How?"

"Bitcoin is permanent," De Vergennes says. "Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger. The blockchain. You can't erase it. The forensics team cross-referenced wallet addresses with exchange records. They tracked conversions from bitcoin to Monero to Ethereum back to bitcoin. They found the patterns."

De Vergennes flips through his notes.

"Key break: twelve days ago, Malik converted ten bitcoin to Swiss francs. He did it through a Zurich exchange. The exchange requires ID verification for fiat conversions. He used false documents. But the exchange keeps records. IP addresses. Login times. Device fingerprints. The forensics team got all of it."

"Location?"

"Zug, Switzerland. City center. Confirmed by multiple data points. IP addresses from the Zurich exchange. Bitcoin purchase confirmations sent to a local ISP. Delivery addresses for physical gold and diamonds. Everything points to Zug."

"How specific?"

"They narrowed it to a few buildings in the city center. Near the lake. The forensics team is still working on the exact apartment. They're analyzing his online activity. Food delivery orders. Package deliveries. Anything that requires a physical address. Should have the specific location within forty-eight hours."

Thomas sits back. The pieces are falling into place.

"How much money is he moving?"

"About forty bitcoin so far. Roughly one million euros. But there's more. The forensics team found deposits into gold purchases. Diamond dealers. Luxury watch retailers. He's converting cryptocurrency into physical assets that can be carried across borders. Portable wealth. Untraceable wealth."

Thomas nods.

"How much money has he moved?"

"So far? About forty bitcoin. Roughly one million euros. But there's more. I'm seeing deposits into physical gold purchases. Diamond dealers. Luxury watch retailers. He's converting cryptocurrency into physical assets."

"Why?"

"Portability. Security. Bitcoin can be seized if governments control the blockchain. Physical gold can be carried. Hidden. Transported across borders. He's preparing for the long term. Building a nest egg."

"Or preparing to run."

"Maybe both."

Thomas watches the screens. Numbers flowing. Transactions connecting. Money moving through digital space. Malik's financial fingerprint spreading across the blockchain.

"What else can you learn from this?" Thomas asks.

"I can see who else he's connected to," De Vergennes says. "Wallet addresses that received funds from the same sources. Potential associates. Other cell members. Other operations."

De Vergennes pulls up a network graph. Nodes and connections. Wallet addresses linked by transactions.

"This is the financial network," De Vergennes says. "Twelve wallets directly connected to the cell. Forty-three wallets one degree removed. Hundreds of wallets two degrees removed. The entire jihadist funding ecosystem visible in the blockchain."

"Can you freeze the accounts?"

"I can try. But it's complicated. Bitcoin isn't controlled by banks. It's decentralized. I can't call a bank and ask them to freeze funds. I'd need to seize the private keys. The passwords. The access credentials."

"Which Malik has."

"Which Malik has."

Thomas thinks about this. Malik has money. Malik has resources. Malik has the ability to fund operations indefinitely. Unless Thomas stops him.

"When we eliminate Malik," Thomas says, "we take his private keys. We seize his wallets. We take control of the money."

"That's illegal," De Vergennes says.

"Everything we're doing is illegal," Thomas says. "What's your point?"

De Vergennes smiles slightly.

"No point. Just making sure we're clear about the mission parameters."

"We're clear."

"The forensics team will have the exact apartment address by the end of the week," De Vergennes says. "They're still analyzing delivery records and IP logs. But they're confident. Within forty-eight hours, we'll have his daily routine. His patterns. Everything we need for surveillance."

"And the other targets?"

"Moreau is tracking communications. We're intercepting cell phone signals. Email accounts. Encrypted messaging apps. If any of them communicate with each other, we'll know."

"Are they communicating?"

"Not yet. They're maintaining radio silence. Professional. They understand operational security."

Thomas nods. The cell is smart. The cell is disciplined. The cell knows that communication means exposure.

But silence means isolation. And isolation means vulnerability.

"Keep tracking," Thomas says. "I want to know the moment any of them breaks silence. The moment any of them makes contact. The moment any of them makes a mistake."

"You'll know," De Vergennes promises.

Thomas leaves the basement. He goes upstairs. The map is still on the wall. Five red dots. Five targets.

Malik's dot is getting clearer. Zug, Switzerland. City center. Near the lake. Apartment building. An address waiting to be discovered.

The blockchain doesn't lie. The blockchain records everything. The blockchain is a permanent record of Malik's financial crimes. And now it's a map leading Thomas directly to him.

Malik thinks cryptocurrency makes him invisible. Malik thinks blockchain anonymity protects him. Malik thinks Switzerland is safe.

Malik doesn't know that every transaction he makes is another step in the trail. Another clue. Another piece of intelligence pointing directly at his location.

The hunt is accelerating. The technology is working. The financial trail is leading exactly where Thomas needs it to go.

Malik is in Zug. Thomas knows where. Soon Thomas will know exactly where. And then Thomas will come for him.

The blockchain never forgets. The ledger never lies. The money trail always leads somewhere.

And in Zug, Switzerland, Malik Benhadj is waiting at the end of it.
