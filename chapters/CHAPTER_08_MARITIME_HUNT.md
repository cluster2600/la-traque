# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 8: MARITIME HUNT

Thomas drives to Marseille. The coastal city. Port city. Where boats leave. Where people disappear.

He knows Yasmine will try to cross the Mediterranean. He knows she'll seek refuge in Algeria. He knows the fishing boats leave from Marseille harbor at night.

He arrives at the port at dawn. The sun is rising over the water. The harbor is waking up. Boats are being prepared. Fishermen are checking nets. The place smells of salt and diesel and ancient trade.

Thomas walks the docks. He shows Yasmine's photograph to every boat captain. Every fisherman. Every port worker. Most don't recognize her. Some refuse to talk. Some look away.

But one old fisherman, weathered by decades at sea, nods.

"She was here," he says. "Three days ago. Touareg driver brought her. They asked about boats. About crossing."

"Where is she now?" Thomas asks.

"Gone," the fisherman says. "Left with a driver. Going south. That's all I know."

Thomas sits in a café overlooking the harbor. He orders coffee. He watches the boats. He understands: Yasmine is already across. Already in Algeria. Already heading to wherever she's going.

The hunt is no longer local. It's international. It's Mediterranean. It's becoming personal pursuit across borders and seas.

Thomas thinks about Jérôme. About the thirty-minute delay. About how much time has passed since his holiday friend died. About how the world has changed. About how France is burning. About how Yasmine is still alive.

He makes a decision.

He goes to the port authority. He shows his DGSE credentials. He demands information about boats departing in recent days. About destinations. About routes. About who was aboard.

The port authority is cooperative. Too many attacks. Too much government pressure. They give him everything.

Within an hour, Thomas has a list of boats. Five fishing vessels that departed heading south in the past seventy-two hours. Five possible routes. Five possibilities.

He contacts a coast guard cutter. He boards with a small team. They head out to sea. South. Into the Mediterranean. Toward Algeria.

The crossing takes a day. By evening, they're in Algerian waters. By night, they're approaching the coast.

Thomas stands on deck. He looks at the lights of Algiers in the distance. Somewhere in that city, Yasmine is there. Or she's already past it. Heading south. Heading inland. Heading to wherever she decided to make her final stand.

The hunt continues. But now it's across the sea. Now it's in a foreign country. Now it's beyond the reach of French authority. Now Thomas is truly rogue. Truly alone. Truly committed to finding her before she disappears forever.
