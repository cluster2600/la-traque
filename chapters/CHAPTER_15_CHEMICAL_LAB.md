# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 15: CHEMICAL LAB

Dr. Sylberstein works in a basement.

Not a glamorous basement. Not a movie basement with dramatic lighting. Just fluorescent tubes and concrete walls. Temperature-controlled. Humidity-monitored. Chemical safety cabinets lining the walls. Gas chromatograph. Mass spectrometer. Atomic absorption spectrometer. The tools of forensic chemistry.

The DGSE chemical lab. Under the Quai d'Orsay. Where explosives are analyzed.

The fragments arrive in metal cases. Chain of custody documentation sealed to each one. Evidence tags. Collection dates. Recovery locations.

Métro 14. Line 14. Multiple blast zones.

Sylberstein is sixty-three years old. She's been analyzing explosives for the French government for forty-one years. She's seen dynamite. C-4. SEMTEX. Military ordnance. Industrial explosives. Homemade bombs. She knows the signature of every explosive ever detonated in France.

She opens the first case.

Charred fragments. Metal shards. Chemical residue on copper wire. The smell of burned TNT and something else. Something fatty. Familiar but not immediately classifiable.

She catalogs each fragment. Photographs. Weighs. Documents. One hundred and thirty-seven distinct pieces from the first device. Arranged on the stainless steel table. Photographed from four angles. Each piece labeled.

She takes samples. Residue from the metal. Carbon deposits from the blast. Trace elements embedded in the copper. Samples go into labeled vials. Glass vials. Sealed. Dated. Initialed.

The gas chromatograph first.

Sample preparation. Solvent extraction. The vial goes into the instrument. Heating element. Separation column. Flame ionization detector. The machine hums. Screen glows. Graph begins to trace.

Sylberstein watches the graph emerge.

Peaks appear. Different peaks for different compounds. The chromatogram unfolds like a fingerprint. Each compound has a retention time. A specific moment when it emerges from the column. Each peak tells her something.

First peak: Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine.

RDX. Cyclonite. Military explosive. But not pure RDX. Mixed with something else.

She adjusts parameters. Runs again. More detailed separation. The graph shows the presence of additional compounds. Organic compounds. Carbon chains. Oxygen-rich molecules.

She recognizes the pattern.

Fatty acids. Long-chain hydrocarbons. Triglycerides.

Animal fat.

She runs the mass spectrometer on the same sample. Ionization. Fragmentation. Detection. The mass spectrum builds line by line. Each line representing a molecule broken into charged fragments.

The pattern is clear.

Palmitic acid. Stearic acid. Oleic acid.

Animal fat. Not plant fat. Animal origin.

She tests another fragment. Different location. Different bomb. Same results. Palmitic acid. Stearic acid. Oleic acid.

And then she sees it.

A trace compound. One percent of the total. But unmistakable.

Skatole.

A compound found in fecal matter. In animal digestion byproducts. In rendering facilities. In places where animal remains are processed.

Pig fat.

Industrial pig fat. Rendered. Processed. Mixed with RDX. Saponified into soap. Detonated as an explosive.

The same method used in the book. Fight Club. Tyler Durden's soap bomb. But here, in a Métro tunnel under Paris, made real.

Sylberstein runs the analysis three more times. Different fragments. Different bombs. Same results every time.

Pig fat mixed with RDX. Military-grade explosive combined with rendered animal fat. Homemade but sophisticated. Homemade but reproducible.

She documents everything. Chain of custody maintained. Results recorded. Analysis logged with timestamp. Her name. Her initials.

Then she calls Thomas.

"The explosives are consistent," she says. "All of them. Same composition. Same manufacturing signature. Same source material."

"What source material?" Thomas asks.

"Pig fat. Rendered and processed. Mixed with RDX and other compounds. The manufacturing process is sophisticated. Whoever did this knew what they were doing. This isn't amateur chemistry. This is professional-grade explosive manufacturing."

"Can you trace the source?"

"The pig fat? No. Could come from anywhere. Industrial rendering. Butcher shops. Food processing. The RDX is military-sourced. But we already knew that. The signature is the combination. The specific ratio. The saponification process. Whoever made these bombs made them all. Same person. Same lab. Same hands."

"Timeline?"

"The bombs were assembled within forty-eight hours of detonation. The explosive is stable. The fat prevents degradation. They made them, they stored them, they deployed them. Professional operation. Professional timeline."

"Fingerprints?"

"One partial on copper wire from device two. Running it against the database now. But Sylberstein, these people knew what they were doing. They didn't leave much."

"What about the Mantes lab? Can you match the materials?"

Sylberstein pulls up the file on her screen. Samples from the Mantes-la-Jolie warehouse. Materials seized. Chemical inventory. Equipment found on-site.

She compares the spectral data. Pig fat residue from Mantes. Pig fat residue from the bombs.

Same source. Same processing. Same signature.

"It matches," she says. "The Mantes lab produced these bombs. Same materials. Same process. Same manufacturing signature. The bombs in the Métro came from Mantes-la-Jolie."

Thomas doesn't speak for five seconds.

"Send me everything," he says. "Full analysis. Chemical profiles. Fingerprint results when they come back. Everything."

"Already uploaded to the secure server. Thirty minutes ago."

"Good. Sylberstein, this is good work."

"There's more," she says. "The DNA."

"DNA?"

"Skin cells in the pig fat. Whoever rendered this fat, whoever processed it, they left cellular material behind. We're running DNA now. Should have results in six hours."

"Call me when you have them."

"I will."

Thomas hangs up.

Sylberstein returns to her instruments. The mass spectrometer is still running. The chromatograph is processing another sample. The laboratory is quiet except for the hum of machinery.

She knows what the DNA will show.

It will show that one person made all the bombs. Same DNA on all samples. Same hands. Same lab. Same cell.

The Mantes lab. The Métro bombs. The Louvre attack. All connected by chemical signature. All made by the same people. All part of the same operation.

Sylberstein had seen this before. In the 1980s. In the Corsican bombing campaigns. In the Basque separatist attacks. The signature of professional explosives manufacturing.

This is not amateur terrorism.

This is organized. This is systematic. This is a cell with training. With resources. With expertise.

The bombs in the Métro tunnel didn't appear by accident.

They were manufactured in Mantes. They were transported in vehicles. They were planted by trained operatives. They were detonated on schedule.

This is a military-grade operation wrapped in terrorist ideologies.

Sylberstein documents her conclusion in her report.

"Explosive composition analysis indicates a single manufacturing source for all devices. Pig fat saponification with RDX creates a distinctive chemical signature present in all three bomb locations. Mantes-la-Jolie lab samples match the Métro device residue with 99.8% confidence. DNA analysis pending. Conclusion: All bombs manufactured by same individual or individuals in controlled laboratory setting."

She signs the report. Dates it. Sends it to Thomas.

The machine hums.

The lab is quiet.

The results are clear.
