# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 22: PALERMO ELIMINATION

2:00 AM. Palermo is asleep.

Beaumont and Tarkovsky approach from different directions. They meet at the adjacent building. The one with roof access. The one with the fire escape.

No words. Just nods. Professional acknowledgment.

Tarkovsky goes first. Up the fire escape. Metal stairs. Quiet steps. He moves like a ghost. Years of Spetsnaz training. Years of silent operations.

Beaumont follows. Slower. Heavier. But still quiet. Still professional.

They reach the roof. Flat tar. Gravel. Air conditioning units humming. The city spread below them. Dark. Quiet. Sleeping.

Tarkovsky crosses to the edge. Looks across the gap. Hassan Jr.'s building. Three meters away. Maybe four. The window is dark. Curtains closed.

He backs up. Gets a running start. Jumps.

He clears the gap easily. Lands on the opposite roof. Rolls. Comes up silent. Checks surroundings. Nothing. No one.

Beaumont jumps next. Heavier landing. But still quiet. Still controlled.

They cross Hassan Jr.'s roof. They find the window. Third floor. Corner apartment. Access point.

Tarkovsky tests the window. Locked. He pulls out a thin blade. Slides it between frame and sash. Jimmies the lock. Old building. Old locks. Easy bypass.

The window opens. Silent. Well-oiled hinges. Like the building is helping them.

Tarkovsky enters first. Weapon drawn. Suppressor attached. Ready.

The room is dark. Storage room. Boxes. Old furniture. Unused space.

Beaumont enters behind him. Closes the window. They stand still. Listen. Waiting for their eyes to adjust. Waiting for sounds. Waiting for any indication they've been noticed.

Nothing. Just silence. Just darkness. Just the sound of their own breathing.

Tarkovsky moves forward. Through the storage room. To the door. Opens it slowly. Hallway. Dark. Empty.

Two doors ahead. One closed. One partially open.

The partially open door shows a kitchen. Empty. Dark. No movement.

The closed door. That's the bedroom. That's where Hassan Jr. sleeps.

Tarkovsky approaches. Beaumont covers. Watching the hallway. Watching the kitchen. Watching for anything unexpected.

Tarkovsky reaches the bedroom door. Tests the handle. Unlocked. He opens it. Inch by inch. Slow. Silent. Professional.

The door opens. The bedroom appears.

Hassan Jr. is in the bed. Alone. Sleeping. Face visible in the dim light from the window. Peaceful. Unaware.

Tarkovsky steps inside. Glock raised. Aim steady. Professional stance.

He crosses the room. Five steps. Four. Three. Two.

He stops beside the bed. Looks down at Hassan Jr. The man who helped plan the attack. The man who helped kill three thousand people. The man who thought Sicily would save him.

Tarkovsky aims. Center of the head. Behind the ear. Angled downward. Into the brain stem. Instant death. No sound. No struggle. No chance to wake.

He pulls the trigger.

The suppressor works. The sound is quiet. A mechanical click. Like a door closing. Nothing more.

Hassan Jr. doesn't move. Doesn't wake. Just dies. The bullet enters his skull. Destroys his brain. Ends his life in an instant.

No dramatic death scene. No final words. No awareness. Just sleep becoming death.

Tarkovsky checks the pulse. Nothing. Confirms the kill. Professional verification.

He looks at Beaumont. Nods.

Done.

They move back through the apartment. Back through the hallway. Back through the storage room. Back to the window.

Tarkovsky exits first. Onto the roof. Beaumont follows. They close the window behind them. Wipe it down. Remove fingerprints. Leave no evidence.

They cross the roof. Back to the gap. Back to the adjacent building.

Tarkovsky jumps first. Clean landing. Beaumont follows. Heavier. But still successful.

Down the fire escape. Quick. Controlled. They reach the ground. The alley. The street.

They separate. Tarkovsky goes north. Beaumont goes south. Different routes. Different directions. Professional extraction.

Tarkovsky walks through Palermo. Quiet streets. Sleeping city. No witnesses. No police. No complications.

He reaches the harbor. 3:15 AM. Beaumont arrives three minutes later.

They walk to the end of a pier. Dark. Isolated. No cameras.

Tarkovsky disassembles his Glock. Drops the pieces into the water. One by one. Slide. Barrel. Frame. Suppressor. Magazine. Springs. Every component. Into the sea. Gone forever.

Beaumont does the same. His weapon disappears into the Mediterranean. Evidence disposed. Trail broken.

"Clean?" Beaumont asks.

"Very clean," Tarkovsky confirms.

They walk to separate hotels. They pack. They check out before dawn. Different airlines. Different flights. Different destinations.

By 6:00 AM, they're at the airport. By 8:00 AM, they're in the air. By noon, they're in Marseille.

Hassan Jr. won't be discovered until evening. His contact will knock on the door. Will get no answer. Will use a spare key. Will find the body. Will call police.

The police will investigate. They'll find no evidence. No fingerprints. No witnesses. No leads. Just a body with a bullet in the head. Professional execution. Unsolved murder. Case file that goes nowhere.

Sicily has mafia killings every month. Hassan Jr. will be one more. One more unsolved murder in a city of unsolved murders.

The Italian authorities won't connect it to Paris. Won't connect it to DGSE. Won't connect it to anything except local crime.

Hassan Jr. dies. The investigation stalls. The case goes cold. Thomas's team disappears.

Perfect execution. Perfect extraction. Perfect deniability.

In Marseille, Thomas receives the confirmation.

"Target two eliminated," Beaumont reports. "Clean operation. No complications. No exposure."

Thomas marks Hassan Jr.'s location on the map. Red X through the dot.

Four targets remaining.

Malik in Zug. Amina in Tunis. Leila in Lisbon. Yasmine in Algeria.

The cell is shrinking. The hunt is accelerating. One by one, Thomas is eliminating them.

Hassan Jr. thought Sicily would protect him. Thought the distance would save him. Thought Thomas couldn't reach him.

He was wrong.

The DGSE has reach. The DGSE has resources. The DGSE has operators who can cross rooftops in the dark and put bullets in skulls without waking neighbors.

Hassan Jr. died in his sleep. Never knew what happened. Never saw his killers. Never had a chance to run or fight or beg.

Professional execution. The kind Thomas demands. The kind his team delivers.

The hunt continues. The cell shrinks. The inevitable approaches.

Three thousand people died in Paris. Now the cell is paying. One elimination at a time. One bullet at a time. One red X at a time.

Thomas looks at the map. Four more dots. Four more targets. Four more eliminations before he reaches Yasmine.

The end is coming. Not today. Not tomorrow. But soon.

Very soon.
