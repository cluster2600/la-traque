# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 2.5: MOTHER'S CALL

Thomas is still at the command center when his phone rings. His personal line. Not DGSE. Not official. Personal.

His mother.

He answers. The noise of the command center swallows the moment. Voices. Sirens. Orders. Death. But his mother's voice cuts through.

"Thomas? Ben jy veilig?" (Thomas? Are you safe?)

Her name is Magdalena van der Merwe. She's sixty-seven. She's from Rhodesia. She speaks Afrikaans. She lives in Mont-Saint-Aignan. Normandy. North of Paris. Away from the city. Away from the attacks.

"Ja, Ma. Ek is veilig," Thomas says. "Ek is by die hoofkwartier." (Yes, Mom. I'm safe. I'm at headquarters.)

"Die ontploffing. Het jy dit gehoor?" (The explosion. Did you hear it?)

"Ek het dit gehoor," he says. (I heard about it.)

"Ek het dit gevoel," she says. "Die hele woonstelling het geskud. Die vensters het gegons. Ek dink dit was 'n aardbewing." (I felt it. The whole apartment shook. The windows rattled. I thought it was an earthquake.)

Thomas closes his eyes. He thinks about Paris. About the explosions. About the chaos in the city. His mother is safe in Normandy. But she felt the distant rumble. She heard the news. She's afraid.

"Jy moet weggaan," he says. (You must leave.)

"Weggaan? Waarheen?" (Leave? Leave where?)

"Parys. Jy moet Parys verlaat." (Paris. You must leave Paris.)

There's silence on the line. His mother doesn't understand. She's lived in Mont-Saint-Aignan for decades. She's safe there. But now the government is in crisis. Now the borders are closing. Now nowhere feels safe.

"Ek verstaan nie," she says. (I don't understand.)

Thomas looks at the casualty count on the screen. 2,391. The number grows every hour. Every hour brings new bodies. New identifications. New losses.

"Dit is nie nou veilig nie," he says. "Daar is protokolle. Kontrolepunte. Ondersoeke. Die land sal chaos wees." (It's not safe right now. There are protocols. Checkpoints. Investigations. The country will be chaos.)

"Maar waarheen sal ek gaan?" (But where would I go?)

Thomas thinks. He thinks about his sister. He thinks about the countryside. He thinks about safety outside the city. Outside the region.

"Jy kan jou suster besoek," he says. "In Montpellier. Sy bly in die platteland. Dit is veilig daar. Dit is ver weg." (You could visit your sister. In Montpellier. She lives in the countryside. It's safe there. It's far away.)

His mother doesn't respond. He's suggested this before. But Montpellier has never felt urgent. Until now.

"Montpellier is baie ver," she says. (Montpellier is very far.)

"Dit is baie veiliger as hier," he says. "Jou suster bly in die platteland. Niemand gaan dit doen nie. Jy kan net vir 'n tyd daar bly. Tot dinge kalm word." (It's much safer than here. Your sister lives in the countryside. No one will target it. You can just stay there for a while. Until things calm down.)

His mother sighs. The sigh of someone who has been pushed to a decision she doesn't want to make.

"Goed," she says. "Ek sal gaan." (All right. I'll go.)

Thomas feels something release in his chest. His mother is safe. His mother is out of Paris. His mother is in the countryside in Montpellier. Away from the chaos and the death and the aftermath.

"Pak liggies," he says. "Ek sal 'n motor stuur. Jy hoef nie te ry nie. Ek sal alles reël." (Pack light. I'll send a car. You don't need to drive. I'll arrange everything.)

"Wanneer?" she asks. (When?)

"Nou. Vandag. Vandag nog." (Now. Today. This very day.)

"Dit is baie vinnig." (That's so fast.)

"Ja. Dit moet vinnig wees." (Yes. It has to be fast.)

There's silence again. His mother processing. His mother understanding that the world has changed. That Paris is not safe. That staying is not an option anymore.

"Goed," she says. "Ek sal pak." (All right. I'll pack.)

"Ek hou van jou," Thomas says. (I love you.)

"Ek hou ook van jou," his mother says. (I love you too.)

She hangs up.

Thomas stands in the command center. Around him, the country is mobilizing. The military is rolling out. The borders are closing. The government is preparing for war.

And his mother is driving to Montpellier to stay with her sister in the countryside.

He looks at the casualty count again. 2,391. And rising.

Somewhere in North Africa, a woman is waiting. A woman who killed thousands. A woman who thinks she's safe.

Thomas makes a note on his pad: "Arrange car for mother. Montpellier. Countryside. Today."

He puts the note aside.

He goes back to work.
