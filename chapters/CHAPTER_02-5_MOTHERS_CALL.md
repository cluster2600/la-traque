# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 2.5: MOTHER'S CALL

Thomas is still at the command center when his phone rings. His personal line. Not DGSE. Not official. Personal.

His mother.

He answers. The noise of the command center swallows the moment. Voices. Sirens. Orders. Death. But his mother's voice cuts through.

"Thomas? Are you safe?"

Her name is Michèle. She's sixty-seven. She lives in the 8th arrondissement. Near the Élysée Palace. Three kilometers from one of the attacks.

"I'm safe," Thomas says. "I'm at headquarters."

"The explosion. Did you hear it?"

"I heard about it," he says.

"I felt it," she says. "The whole apartment shook. The windows rattled. I thought it was an earthquake."

Thomas closes his eyes. He thinks about the Élysée Palace. Three hundred and forty-one people dead. And his mother felt the explosion from three kilometers away.

"You should leave," he says.

"Leave? Leave where?"

"Paris. Leave Paris."

There's silence on the line. His mother doesn't understand. She's lived in Paris for sixty-seven years. She's never left. Paris is home.

"I don't understand," she says.

Thomas looks at the casualty count on the screen. 2,391. The number grows every hour. Every hour brings new bodies. New identifications. New losses.

"It's not safe right now," he says. "There are protocols. Checkpoints. Investigations. The city is going to be chaos."

"But where would I go?"

Thomas thinks. He thinks about Taka. He thinks about Tokyo. He thinks about his daughter. His granddaughter. The child he barely knows because he's been consumed with work. Because he's been consumed with duty.

"You could visit Taka," he says. "In Tokyo. You could see your granddaughter."

His mother doesn't respond. He's suggested this before. Many times. She's always said no. She's said Paris is home. She's said she doesn't like flying. She's said she doesn't understand Japanese.

"I don't like flying," she says.

"I know."

"And I don't speak Japanese."

"Taka speaks French," he says. "You could spend time with your granddaughter. You could get out of Paris for a while. Until things calm down."

"How long?" his mother asks.

"A few weeks. A month. Until the situation stabilizes."

His mother sighs. The sigh of someone who has been pushed to a decision she doesn't want to make.

"All right," she says. "I'll go."

Thomas feels something release in his chest. His mother is safe. His mother is out of Paris. His mother is away from the chaos and the death and the aftermath.

"Pack light," he says. "I'll arrange a flight. First class. Direct to Tokyo. You won't have to worry about anything."

"When?" she asks.

"Tomorrow morning. Early."

"That's so fast."

"Yes."

There's silence again. His mother processing. His mother understanding that the world has changed. That Paris is not safe. That staying is not an option anymore.

"All right," she says. "Tomorrow."

"I love you," Thomas says.

"I love you too," his mother says.

She hangs up.

Thomas stands in the command center. Around him, the country is mobilizing. The military is rolling out. The borders are closing. The government is preparing for war.

And his mother is going to Tokyo to see her granddaughter.

He looks at the casualty count again. 2,391. And rising.

Somewhere in North Africa, a woman is waiting. A woman who killed his son. A woman who killed three thousand people. A woman who thinks she's safe.

Thomas makes a note on his pad: "Arrange flight for mother. First class. Tomorrow morning. Direct to Tokyo."

He puts the note aside.

He goes back to work.
