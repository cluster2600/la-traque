# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 35: TADRART INSERTION

The intelligence comes from the wheelchair.

The failed bomb under Abdelkrim's chair. The device that should have detonated at 6:00 AM in Métro 14 but instead led to the identification of the fourth cell member. The forensic discovery that cracked everything open.

From Abdelkrim, they traced to Malik. From Malik's encrypted notebooks and computer records, they traced to the financing network. From the bitcoin transactions and cryptocurrency wallets, they traced to Zug. To the safe. To the documents.

And in that safe, they found everything else.

Malik's safe in Zug. The documents they found. Papers. Folios. Details about everything.

Names. Locations. Hassan's house in Tadrart. The refuge. The route. The contact. Everything the cell needed. Everything Malik financed. Everything written down by a man who needed insurance.

Thomas had the coordinates from the deed. The Touareg contacts had been activated days ago. Surveillance reports came in hourly. The target was still there. Still waiting. Still believing she was safe.

But the wheelchair had already revealed the network. The failed device was the first domino. Every other domino fell from there.

The house belonged to Malik.

A refuge. A backup. A place where the network could hide if everything collapsed. Malik owned it. Malik maintained it. Malik kept the papers about it in his safe in Zug.

And now those papers had killed Yasmine.

She was there. Waiting. Hiding. Thinking the refuge was secret. Thinking she was safe.

But Malik's documentation in his Zug safe had listed everything. The location. The address. The purpose. The coordinates.

The safe had been opened. The papers had been read. The location had been extracted.

And Thomas was coming.

Six days had passed since Evian.

The Forbin left Toulon on schedule. A Fregate porte-hélicoptères. Officially: anti-piracy patrol off the coast of Mali. Unofficially: launching point for a classified operation deep in the Sahara.

Three days at sea. Two days positioning off the coast of western Sahara. One day of final reconnaissance through Touareg contacts.

Now Thomas is aboard a Super Puma helicopter. Military transport. Professional crew. They've done this before.

The Super Puma takes off from the Forbin deck. Two hours inland. Low altitude. Below radar coverage. Destination: north of Tindouf. A desert plateau where the Touaregs wait. Where the Sahara is flat enough for landing.

The helicopter descends. Dust rises. The landing zone appears beneath them. Desert. Flat. Empty. Perfect.

The Super Puma touches down.

Thomas steps out with his team. Six DGSE operators. Armed. Ready. Silent.

Waiting in the dust is a Touareg delegation. Three men. Dark robes. Veiled. Experienced. Hassan's people. They've been watching Tadrart for six days. They know if she's still there. They know if she's moved.

"She's there," the lead Touareg says in French. "In the stone house. Two servants. Still waiting."

Thomas nods.

The Touaregs gesture toward the ground. Three Toyota Land Cruisers. Old. Desert-worn. Ready.

No helicopters overhead. Not yet. Air support waits on the coast. They move in only if the ground team needs extraction or fire support. This is a ground operation. Small. Professional. Deniable.

"We move now," the lead Touareg says. "Before the afternoon heat."

The team loads equipment. Weapons secured. Ammunition checked. Two Glock 19s with suppressors for each operator. Two FN P90s with suppressors for contingency. Professional loadout. Quiet. Effective.

The Touaregs distribute robes. Desert clothes. Local dress. Indigo. Wrapped. Effective camouflage. The team changes. They look like locals now. They look like Touaregs. They look like they belong in the Sahara.

Thomas checks his Glock. The suppressor is clean. The magazine is full. The trigger is ready.

"Tadrart is three hours south," the lead Touareg says. "Small village. Edge of desert. House is on the south side. Stone construction. Single entrance. No electricity. No water except containers."

"How many?" Thomas asks.

"Two servants. Possibly armed. Hassan paid for protection. The target is inside. Waiting."

Thomas checks his Glock. The suppressor is clean. The magazine is full. The trigger is ready.

"We move," he says.

The three Toyotas drive south. Into the desert. No road. Just sand. But the Touaregs know the way. They move between rocks. They navigate by stars and memory. They move like ghosts through the Sahara.

Thomas sits in the back of the first Toyota. He looks out at the desert. At the stars. At the place where everything ends.

The Touareg driving doesn't speak. He just drives. He knows where to go. He knows what's coming.

The village appears at dawn. Small. Just buildings clustered around a well. Tadrart. A place so small it barely exists. A place so remote that governments can't reach. A place so isolated that a woman can hide forever.

Until someone decides she can't.

The Toyotas stop a kilometer outside the village. The team exits. They move on foot. Robed. Armed. Silent. They move like Touaregs. They move like they belong.

The house is where the Touareg said. Stone construction. Simple. A door on the south side. A window. No signs of life.

Thomas approaches the door. His Glock is ready. His suppressor is clean. His commitment is absolute.

The door opens.

A servant appears. He sees them. He understands immediately. He reaches for something.

The first shot is silent. The suppressor works perfectly. The servant falls. One shot. One kill. No alarms. No noise. Just death and silence.

The second servant emerges from the back. He's armed. He's fast. But he's not fast enough.

Two shots. Two suppressors. Two deaths. Professional. Quick. Quiet.

Thomas enters the house. His team follows. They move through the rooms. They clear the space.

She's in the back. In a bedroom. She's alone. She's waiting.

Yasmine Boudjellal.

Twenty-two years old. Female. Small. Fragile-looking. The woman who killed three thousand people.

She looks up when Thomas enters. She sees him. She sees the robed figure in the desert night. She sees the gun.

She doesn't recognize him. She's never seen his face. She doesn't know who he is.

"Who are you?" she asks.

Thomas steps forward. The suppressor is ready. The magazine is full.

"Does it matter?" he says.

Yasmine stands. She's not afraid. She's calm. She's been waiting for this moment for months. She knew it would come. She just didn't know when.

"You're French," she says. "Military. DGSE probably."

Thomas doesn't answer. He just raises the Glock. He aims at her center mass.

Yasmine doesn't run. She doesn't beg. She just looks at him.

"You lost someone," she says. "I can see it. In your eyes. You lost someone in Paris."

Thomas's jaw tightens. But he doesn't speak. He doesn't confirm. He doesn't deny.

"A friend," he says. "A holiday friend."

Yasmine nods. "Then this is about duty. And vengeance. Both. Mixed together. You think you're coming to get justice. But you're really coming for blood."

"Yes," Thomas says.

"I killed a lot of people," Yasmine says. "Three thousand. Maybe more. And nobody understands why. Nobody sees the righteous rage. Nobody sees what France did to Algeria. Nobody sees the colonial debt being paid."

Thomas raises the Glock higher. His aim is steady. His commitment is absolute.

"I don't care why you did it," he says. "I only care that you did."

Yasmine accepts this. She nods. She understands. There is no debate here. There is no argument. There is only execution.

"What's your name?" she asks.

Thomas doesn't answer.

The first shot is silent. The suppressor works perfectly. Yasmine falls.

One shot. One kill. One moment. One ending.

She never knew his name. She never knew who hunted her. She never knew that her life would end in a stone house in Tadrart. At the hands of a man she'd never met. Because of a friend she'd never killed.

This is where it ends. In a stone house in Tadrart. In the Sahara. In the middle of nowhere.

This is where everything stops.

Thomas lowers the Glock. He looks at the body. He looks at the woman who killed his friend. Who killed three thousand people. Who was never even aware that Thomas existed.

The hunt is over.

Thomas turns and walks out. His team follows. They move back to the Toyotas. They drive north. Back to the coast. Back to the Super Puma. Back to France.

Behind them, Tadrart remains small and quiet. A place where someone died. A place where justice was executed. A place that will never know it happened.

## INTELLIGENCE SOURCE QUESTION SOLVED:

**How they know about Tadrart:**

Hassan Medjahed (cell ideologue, captured in Lyon) broke under DGSE interrogation and revealed:
- Yasmine's escape route (south)
- Safe house destination (Tadrart)
- Malik's house location (Tadrart, in safe papers)
- Servant details (protection infrastructure)
- Exact coordinates

This intelligence chain:
1. Hassan captured during sweep (Chapter 7/early investigation)
2. Interrogated in Lyon
3. Breaks under pressure
4. Gives up entire network
5. DGSE confirms via satellite
6. Thomas gets coordinates
7. Operation proceeds from there

This also establishes why Hassan Jr. (Hassan's son) escaped differently - his father was captured early, so the younger Hassan had to flee alone.
