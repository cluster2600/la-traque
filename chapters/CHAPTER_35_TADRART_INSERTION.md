# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 35: TADRART INSERTION

The intelligence comes from Hassan.

Hassan Medjahed was captured in Lyon. He broke under interrogation. Not immediately. Not easily. But eventually, he broke.

He gave up the cell's locations. He gave up the safe houses. He gave up the escape routes. And he gave up Tadrart.

"She's going south," Hassan said. "To my cousin's house. Tadrart. Desert refuge. Hassan will protect her there."

Thomas had the coordinates within hours. The DGSE had Satellite imagery within days. A small house. On the edge of a desert town. Inhabited. Servants moving in and out. The target location.

Now Thomas is in a Horizon-class helicopter. A military transport. Fast. Armed. Built for special operations insertion.

The helicopter cuts across the Mediterranean. From a French naval frigate off the coast. Two hours of flight time. Destination: the coast of Morocco. Western Sahara. A remote stretch of coastline where nobody asks questions.

The helicopter descends. Low altitude. Below radar. The crew is military. Professional. They know the drill.

The coastline appears. Rocky. Isolated. A small beach. A landing zone.

The helicopter touches down.

Thomas steps out with his team. Six DGSE operators. Armed. Ready. Silent.

Waiting on the beach is a Touareg delegation. Three men. Dark robes. Veiled. Experienced. Hassan's people. They know the route. They know the terrain. They know how to move through the Sahara unseen.

"Welcome," the lead Touareg says in French.

Thomas nods.

The Touaregs gesture to the helicopters. Three more helicopters descend from above. Not transports. Attack helicopters. They stay aloft. Covering the operation.

"We move now," the lead Touareg says. "Before light."

The small airfield is hidden behind the rocks. Three Toyota Land Cruisers. Old. Desert-worn. Ready.

The team loads equipment. Weapons secured. Ammunition checked. Two Glock 19s with suppressors for each operator. Two FN P90s with suppressors for contingency. Professional loadout. Quiet. Effective.

The Touaregs distribute robes. Desert clothes. Local dress. Indigo. Wrapped. Effective camouflage. The team changes. They look like locals now. They look like Touaregs. They look like they belong in the Sahara.

"Tadrart is three hours south," the lead Touareg says. "Small village. Edge of desert. House is on the south side. Stone construction. Single entrance. No electricity. No water except containers."

"How many?" Thomas asks.

"Two servants. Possibly armed. Hassan paid for protection. The target is inside. Waiting."

Thomas checks his Glock. The suppressor is clean. The magazine is full. The safety is off.

"We move," he says.

The three Toyotas drive south. Into the desert. No road. Just sand. But the Touaregs know the way. They move between rocks. They navigate by stars and memory. They move like ghosts through the Sahara.

Thomas sits in the back of the first Toyota. He looks out at the desert. At the stars. At the place where everything ends.

The Touareg driving doesn't speak. He just drives. He knows where to go. He knows what's coming.

The village appears at dawn. Small. Just buildings clustered around a well. Tadrart. A place so small it barely exists. A place so remote that governments can't reach. A place so isolated that a woman can hide forever.

Until someone decides she can't.

The Toyotas stop a kilometer outside the village. The team exits. They move on foot. Robed. Armed. Silent. They move like Touaregs. They move like they belong.

The house is where the Touareg said. Stone construction. Simple. A door on the south side. A window. No signs of life.

Thomas approaches the door. His Glock is ready. His suppressor is clean. His commitment is absolute.

The door opens.

A servant appears. He sees them. He understands immediately. He reaches for something.

The first shot is silent. The suppressor works perfectly. The servant falls. One shot. One kill. No alarms. No noise. Just death and silence.

The second servant emerges from the back. He's armed. He's fast. But he's not fast enough.

Two shots. Two suppressors. Two deaths. Professional. Quick. Quiet.

Thomas enters the house. His team follows. They move through the rooms. They clear the space.

She's in the back. In a bedroom. She's alone. She's waiting.

Yasmine Boudjellal.

Twenty-two years old. Female. Small. Fragile-looking. The woman who killed three thousand people.

She looks up when Thomas enters. She sees him. She sees the robed figure in the desert night. She sees the gun.

She understands.

For the first time in her life, someone has found her. Someone has hunted her. Someone has seen her.

Thomas sees her. Not as a terrorist. Not as a killer. But as a woman. Young. Afraid. Alone.

"It's over," he says.

Yasmine doesn't run. She doesn't fight. She just sits on the bed. She looks at Thomas.

"You're Thomas," she says.

"Yes."

"You came to kill me."

"Yes."

Yasmine nods. She understands. She accepts. She waits.

Thomas raises his Glock. The suppressor is clean. The magazine is full.

This is where it ends. In a stone house in Tadrart. In the Sahara. In the middle of nowhere.

This is where everything stops.

## INTELLIGENCE SOURCE QUESTION SOLVED:

**How they know about Tadrart:**

Hassan Medjahed (cell ideologue, captured in Lyon) broke under DGSE interrogation and revealed:
- Yasmine's escape route (south)
- Safe house destination (Tadrart)
- Hassan's cousin location (Tadrart)
- Servant details (protection infrastructure)
- Exact coordinates

This intelligence chain:
1. Hassan captured during sweep (Chapter 7/early investigation)
2. Interrogated in Lyon
3. Breaks under pressure
4. Gives up entire network
5. DGSE confirms via satellite
6. Thomas gets coordinates
7. Operation proceeds from there

This also establishes why Hassan Jr. (Hassan's son) escaped differently - his father was captured early, so the younger Hassan had to flee alone.
