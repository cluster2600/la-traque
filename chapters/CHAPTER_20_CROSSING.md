# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 20: CROSSING

Yasmine boards Rachid's fishing boat at midnight.

The harbor is dark. No lights. No witnesses. Just Rachid and his crew. Three men. Algerian. Professional smugglers. They've done this a thousand times.

Rachid is older. Fifty. Gray beard. Weathered face. He looks at Yasmine without recognition. He doesn't know who she is. He doesn't know what she did. He just knows she's paying cash. A lot of cash.

"Three thousand euros," Rachid says. "Half now. Half when we arrive in Algiers."

Yasmine hands him fifteen hundred euros. Cash. Bills folded tight. Money she withdrew from cell accounts before escaping Paris.

Rachid counts it. Nods. Pockets it.

"Get below deck," he says. "Stay out of sight. We leave in ten minutes."

Yasmine goes below. The boat smells like fish. Old fish. Dead fish. Fish that's been rotting in nets for years. She tries not to breathe deeply.

The cabin is small. Bunks. Nets. Equipment. No windows. No light except a single dim bulb.

She sits on a bunk. She waits.

Above deck, the engines start. The boat moves. Slowly at first. Out of the harbor. Past the breakwater. Into open water.

Yasmine feels the motion. The boat rocking. The Mediterranean beneath her. The crossing beginning.

She's leaving France. Leaving the manhunt. Leaving Thomas. Leaving everything except the memory of what she did.

Three thousand people dead. The Louvre destroyed. Paris burning. France in chaos.

She did that. She planned it. She executed it. And now she's escaping.

The boat picks up speed. The engines roar. The hull cuts through water. Marseille disappears behind them. Algeria waits ahead.

Yasmine closes her eyes. She tries to sleep. She can't. Too much adrenaline. Too much fear. Too much awareness that this is the moment of maximum vulnerability.

If the French Navy intercepts this boat, she's finished. If coast guard radar picks them up, she's finished. If Rachid decides three thousand euros isn't enough and turns her in for the reward, she's finished.

She's trusting smugglers. Trusting the sea. Trusting darkness.

Above deck, Rachid navigates by stars. No GPS. No electronic navigation. Nothing that can be tracked. Just old-school seamanship. The kind that's been moving people across the Mediterranean for thousands of years.

The crew works silently. They know their roles. They know the route. They know the risks.

Yasmine hears their footsteps above. Hears the engines. Hears the water against the hull. Hears nothing else. No pursuit. No interception. No alarms.

Maybe she's going to make it.

Hours pass. Yasmine loses track of time. Below deck, there's no day. No night. Just the constant rocking. The constant engine noise. The constant smell of fish.

She thinks about the cell. About Malik. About Hassan Jr. About Amina. About Farid and Leila. About everyone who helped her. Everyone who shared her rage. Everyone who believed France needed to pay.

Are they safe? Are they hiding? Are they thinking about her?

She doesn't know. The cell scattered. No communication. No contact. Operational security demanded silence. Now silence means isolation.

She's alone on this boat. Alone in this cabin. Alone in the dark with the smell of fish and the memory of three thousand dead.

Somewhere behind her, Thomas is hunting. She doesn't know his name. She doesn't know his face. She just knows someone is coming. Someone relentless. Someone who won't stop.

She felt him in Paris. The pressure. The pursuit. The closing net. The DGSE dragnet searching every safe house. Every contact. Every connection.

She escaped by hours. Maybe minutes. The gap between hunter and prey measured in time too small to calculate.

But now there's the Mediterranean between them. Now there's distance. Now there's the vastness of North Africa. Now there's Algeria's refusal to cooperate with French intelligence.

Now there's safety. Maybe.

The boat slows. Yasmine hears movement above. Voices. The engines cutting back. The motion changing.

She goes to the ladder. Climbs up. Peers above deck.

Dawn. The sky is lightening. And ahead: the coastline. Algeria. Brown cliffs. White buildings. Algiers rising from the sea.

They made it.

Rachid sees her.

"Stay below until we dock," he says. "Then you leave quickly. No looking back. No thanks. You were never here. We never met. Understand?"

Yasmine nods.

She goes back below. She waits. She feels the boat maneuvering. Feels it slow. Feels it bump against something. The dock. They're here.

Footsteps above. Ropes being tied. The engines shutting off. Silence.

Rachid appears at the ladder.

"Now," he says. "Go."

Yasmine climbs up. She steps onto the deck. The harbor is quiet. Early morning. Few people. Rachid points to the gangway.

She hands him the remaining fifteen hundred euros. He takes it without counting. Without speaking. Without acknowledgment.

She walks down the gangway. Onto the dock. Onto Algerian soil.

Behind her, the boat is already preparing to leave. Rachid doesn't want to stay. Doesn't want to be associated. Doesn't want questions.

Yasmine walks into Algiers. Into the city. Into the crowds. Into invisibility.

She's here. She's safe. She made it.

The Mediterranean is behind her. France is behind her. The manhunt is behind her.

Ahead is Algeria. Ahead is hiding. Ahead is waiting for the pursuit to fade.

She doesn't know that Thomas is already in Marseille. Doesn't know that Rachid's boat was noticed. Doesn't know that a weathered fisherman saw her and will mention her to DGSE.

She doesn't know the trail she left. The witnesses. The connections. The breadcrumbs leading Thomas directly to her.

She thinks she's safe.

The Mediterranean is not as wide as she hoped.

Yasmine disappears into Algiers. Into the streets. Into the plan she made with Hassan. The apartment. The burka. The waiting.

She thinks she has time. Time to hide. Time to plan. Time to survive.

She doesn't know Thomas is crossing the same water. Coming the same route. Following the same trail.

The hunt is twelve hours behind her. And closing.
