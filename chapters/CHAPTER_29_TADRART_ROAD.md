# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 29: TADRART ROAD

The Touareg driver waits outside the Sofitel.

Old Toyota Land Cruiser. Sand in the tires. Dents on the doors. Blue robe. Veiled face. Only his eyes visible. Dark. Unreadable.

He doesn't look at Yasmine like a man looks at a woman.

He looks at her like cargo.

"Hassan sent me," he says in French.

Accent thick. Voice flat.

That's all.

Yasmine gets in.

She carries one bag. Clothes. Cash. A knife. Nothing else.

They drive south.

Out of Algiers. Past suburbs with concrete apartment blocks. Past checkpoints manned by bored soldiers.

The driver shows papers at each one. Local contacts. Payments. Respect.

No questions.

The soldiers wave them through.

The road turns into emptiness.

Dust. Heat. Flat land stretching to the horizon.

Then mountains. Rocky. Brown. Ancient.

Then more emptiness.

The landscape changes. Green disappears. Trees disappear. Signs of life disappear.

Just earth and sky.

They stop at a roadside station at night. One bulb hanging from a wire. One pump. Men drinking tea under a tin roof.

Yasmine stays in the car.

The men look at her.

Not with desire.

With suspicion.

She is a woman. Alone. With a Touareg. That means trouble.

The driver returns with bread and water.

He passes it to her without a word.

They drive again.

Second day. Third.

The road deteriorates. Pavement becomes gravel. Gravel becomes dirt. Dirt becomes sand.

Yasmine's phone has no signal. The world narrows to the Toyota's cabin and the driver's silence.

She tries to talk.

"How far?" she asks.

"Far," he says.

"Why Tadrart?"

"Because Hassan pays," he says.

Then silence again.

That's the Touareg way. Transaction and distance.

Yasmine watches the land change.

Green disappears.

Concrete disappears.

People disappear.

There is only rock and sand.

The heat is brutal. Dry. It bakes the car. She drinks water constantly. Sweats through her clothes.

At night the temperature drops. She wraps herself in a blanket. Shivers.

The driver sleeps in the front seat. Doesn't offer conversation. Doesn't offer comfort.

Just transport.

On the third day, they pass a caravan. Camels. Men in blue robes. Moving slowly across the sand.

The driver waves. The men wave back.

No words. Just gestures.

This is a world without language. Without borders. Without law.

Just movement and survival.

At dusk on the third day, the driver points ahead.

"Tadrart," he says.

The town is small. A cluster of buildings around a well. Stone houses. Tin roofs. No lights. No signs. End of the road.

Literally.

Beyond this, there is only desert.

They stop in front of a stone house.

Two servants open the door. A man and a woman. Faces blank. Eyes trained. They don't greet her. They don't smile.

They just stand aside.

The driver gives Yasmine a key.

He doesn't say goodbye.

He doesn't wish her luck.

He just drives away.

Dust trail behind him. Then nothing.

Yasmine stands in front of the house.

She looks around.

No street. No neighbors. No noise.

Just silence.

She goes inside.

The house is prepared. Water containers. Food. Canned goods. Dates. Bread. Cash on a table. A bed.

A refuge.

A cage.

The walls are thick. The windows are small. The air is cool despite the heat outside.

She sits on the bed and listens.

No traffic.

No city.

No sea.

Just desert wind.

It whispers against the walls. Constant. Relentless.

This is where Hassan sends her to wait.

This is where she believes time will save her.

Time to let the manhunt fade.

Time to let France forget.

Time to rebuild.

She doesn't know time is what kills her.

Because time is what Thomas uses.

Time to track.

Time to coordinate.

Time to come.

Yasmine lies down.

She stares at the ceiling. Cracks in the plaster. A spider web in the corner.

She thinks of France.

She thinks of Algeria.

She belongs to neither.

France wants her dead.

Algeria doesn't want her at all.

She is exile. She is isolation. She is the end of a line.

Outside, the desert keeps its own time.

Slow.

Patient.

Relentless.

The wind blows. The sand shifts. The sun sets.

Yasmine closes her eyes.

She dreams of Paris. Of the metro. Of fire. Of screaming.

She dreams of her mother's voice. Telling stories of French atrocities. Telling her she was a daughter of Algeria.

But Algeria doesn't claim her.

Algeria just gave her a stone house and silence.

In the morning, she wakes to heat.

The servants bring water. Food. They don't speak. They just leave it and go.

She walks outside.

The desert stretches forever. Empty. Beautiful. Hostile.

She sees nomads in the distance. Tiny figures against vast sand.

She sees nothing else.

No roads. No cars. No planes overhead.

This is off the grid. This is the end of the world.

This is where Yasmine thinks she's safe.

But safety is an illusion.

And time is running out.

Somewhere in France, Thomas is tracking cryptocurrency transactions. Satellite images. Signal bursts.

He doesn't know she's in Tadrart yet.

But he will.

The net is tightening.

And the desert, for all its emptiness, doesn't hide people forever.

It just delays the inevitable.

Yasmine sits on the stone steps.

She waits.

For what, she doesn't know.

Redemption. Vindication. Revenge.

None of it comes.

Just heat. Silence. Wind.

And somewhere, getting closer, a team of French operators preparing to cross into Algeria.

Authorized.

Deniable.

Final.
