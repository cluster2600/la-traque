# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 32: LAKE ENTRY

### 23:00 — The Bedroom

Malik stands at the window overlooking the lake. Crystal glass in his hand. Expensive wine. 55 years old. 150 kilos. Heavy man in an expensive suit. Drunk enough to not hear them. Alert enough that when he turns, his face goes pale.

Thomas's Glock is already pointed at his chest.

"Don't move," Thomas says. Quiet. No emotion.

Malik's glass drops. Crystal shatters on hardwood. The sound is loud in the silence.

"Safe," Thomas says. "Where is it."

Malik points to the closet.

### 23:02 — The Closet

The safe is large. Professional. Bolted to the floor. Modern combination lock with a digital keypad.

De Vergennes studies it. Reinforced frame. Military grade. Not a consumer model.

"Open it," Leclerc says. Gun at Malik's back. 9mm Glock with a suppressor. Business-like.

Malik's hands shake. He tries the combination. His fingers are thick. Slow. Sweating.

He fails the first time. Tries again.

His hands move across the keypad. Numbers. Wrong. Again. Panic is making him clumsy.

"Again," Leclerc says.

Malik tries once more.

The safe opens.

Inside is wealth beyond counting.

Gold bars stacked like building blocks. Twenty-four of them. Ten kilograms each. Yellow metal that glows under the bedroom light. The kind of gold that buys countries.

Diamonds in small leather pouches. Six pouches. Loose certified stones. Each one worth more than a car. Together worth more than a house.

US Treasury bearer bonds in sleeves. Tens of millions in untraceable currency. The ultimate escape fund. The kind of money that doesn't exist in any bank. The kind of money that buys new identities, new countries, new lives.

Cash. Stacks. Fifty-pound notes. Euros. Dollars. One thousand franc notes. Two hundred thousand total.

Watches. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre. Twenty-seven of them. Tens of thousands each. The watches of men who have killed to maintain their wealth.

And documents. Papers. Folios. Bank account numbers. Names in ink. Dates. Coordinates written in pencil. Shell company registrations. Cayman Islands. Panama. Switzerland.

Everything.

The coordinates that lead to Hassan.

The bank accounts that connect to Yasmin.

De Vergennes photographs the documents with a secure military camera. Fast. Professional. No fingerprints. He wears gloves.

Tarkovsky and Leclerc load the gold bars into military duffel bags. Heavy work. The bars weigh ten kilos each. 240 kilos total. They move with precision. No wasted motion.

The diamonds are secured in a single leather case. Small. Valuable. Portable.

The bearer bonds are folded carefully. Hidden in a messenger bag. Millions folded like legal documents.

The watches are wrapped in cloth and bagged.

The cash is counted quickly. Loaded. Two hundred thousand.

Three minutes. Everything essential secured.

Thomas wipes the bedroom. His gloves leave no prints. He wipes the window. The door handles. Anything his hands touched. De Vergennes wipes the safe.

Tarkovsky wipes the closet.

Leclerc wipes the stairs.

No DNA. No fingerprints. No forensic evidence. Just a safe opened by force and emptied by professionals who know how to disappear.

Thomas looks at Malik. The old man's fear is primal now. He understands that his money means nothing. That Switzerland is just geography. That safety is an illusion maintained by people who have not yet decided to take it away.

"Don't move for one hour," Thomas says. "Call police after one hour. Not before."

Malik nods. Understanding comes without words when a gun is involved.

### 23:08 — Exit

They move downstairs.

The second floor is loud with the party. Music thumping. Bass line from an American pop song. Voices. Laughter. Drunk men and hired women completely unaware that their host has just been robbed.

Leclerc and Tarkovsky enter the party room with their guns visible.

"No one leaves," Leclerc says. Quiet. Professional.

The girls freeze. The men freeze. The understanding is immediate and total.

Money and guns translate the same in every language.

Leclerc and Tarkovsky stand in the doorway. Blocking the exit. Calm. Patient. Waiting for forty minutes to pass before anyone can call the police.

Thomas and De Vergennes move to the dock.

They wipe the dock door as they leave. Inside and outside. No prints.

The night is still black. The lake is still empty. The lights in the homes around Zug are still off.

They return to the cars. Beaumont is waiting in the van. No signal. No communication. Silence is security.

### 23:15 — Road to Evian

Two DGSE service cars head south from Zug.

Through Valais. Swiss mountains. Remote. Few witnesses at night.

Thomas drives the lead car. Tarkovsky in the passenger seat. Leclerc and De Vergennes in back with the duffels. Gold and diamonds and millions in untraceable bonds.

The second car follows. Four operatives. Moreau driving. The second team maintaining professional distance.

The mountain roads are empty at 23:15. Swiss 9. Direction Valais. No speeding. No attention. Just professional operators moving through the night like ghosts.

The motorway vignette is already on the service cars. €40. Everything legal. Everything documented.

Route: South through Valais toward Lake Geneva. Evian across the border. Small town. Tourist property. Perfect deniability.

The drive is silent. No radio. No communication. No unnecessary movement.

Just the hum of the engines and the darkness of Switzerland passing.

### 03:30 — Evian Border

The border at Evian is quiet at 3:30 AM.

Lake Geneva crossing. Customs checkpoint. Single officer. Tired. Routine.

The lead car passes through first. DGSE service plates. French business documents. Real identities created by the Bureau des Légendes. Real paperwork. Real bank accounts. Real business registration in Lyon.

Everything checks.

The customs officer waves them through.

The second car follows. Same procedure. Same legend.

They're in France.

They're out of Switzerland.

### 03:45 — Evian Safe House

Apartment overlooking Lake Geneva. One-bedroom. Tourist property. Prepared weeks ago. Keys under the mat. Booking in a false name.

They unload the duffels in silence.

Gold bars are laid on the table. Twenty-four of them. Yellow metal. Heavy. Beautiful. Deadly.

Diamonds in pouches. Small stones. Massive value.

Bearer bonds. Folded. Millions in untraceable currency.

Cash. Two hundred thousand. Organized in stacks.

Watches. Twenty-seven. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre. Tens of thousands each.

Documents. Photographs. Bank accounts. Names. Coordinates. Shell companies. Everything Thomas needs to find Hassan. Everything that will lead to Yasmin.

De Vergennes secures the gold in a reinforced bag. Military-grade waterproofing. Hidden compartments. The kind of bag that survives interrogation.

By 04:00, everything is secured.

By 04:00, the operation is complete.

Thomas steps outside.

Evian is asleep. French lake town. Pre-dawn. Nothing moving. Lake Geneva is black. Silent.

In Zug, Malik sits in his bedroom waiting for one hour to pass.

When he calls police, the investigation will begin.

But it won't start with forensics.

No fingerprints. No DNA. No physical evidence.

It will start with Malik's own financial records.

With witness testimony about the safe.

With bank trails leading to Hassan.

With shell companies in the Cayman Islands.

With names documented in the deed.

The money always leaves a trail.

The money always reveals itself.

And when investigators follow the money, they will find Hassan.

But by then, Thomas will already be hunting.
