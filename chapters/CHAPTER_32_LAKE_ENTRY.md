# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 32: LAKE ENTRY

The lake is black.

The dock is darker.

Thomas moves with Tarkovsky, De Vergennes, and Leclerc.

Soft footsteps on wooden planks. No talking. Hand signals only.

Beaumont and Richelieu are on the street side. Watching the road. Watching for Swiss police. Watching for lights.

Moreau sits in a car two blocks away. Radio discipline. Short bursts. No phones.

"Clear," Beaumont whispers through the earpiece.

Thomas acknowledges with two clicks.

They reach the sliding doors.

Glass. Open. Warm air spilling out.

Music inside. Electronic beat. American. Loud.

Laughter.

Perfume.

The smell of expensive alcohol and cheap decisions.

Malik's voice. High. Excited. Speaking French with an accent.

Thomas looks in.

Four men.

Three women.

Bodies half dressed.

Champagne bottles. Cocaine on a mirror. Pills in a bowl.

A transaction pretending to be a party.

Malik in the center.

Fat.

Oiled.

Smiling.

Gold chain around his neck. Rolex on his wrist.

Blood money made visible.

Thomas steps through the door.

No shout.

No warning.

Just presence.

The room freezes.

Music keeps playing. But movement stops.

For a second, nobody understands.

Then they do.

Malik's smile dies. His eyes widen.

He understands.

Not the details.

The outcome.

Thomas nods once.

Tarkovsky covers the three other men. Suppressed weapon. Calm. Professional.

Leclerc gestures to the women.

"Dehors," he says.

Out.

They scramble for clothes. Grab purses. Run.

High heels clicking on tile. The door slams.

Thomas lets them.

They aren't the mission.

They are noise.

Witnesses who won't talk. Too much to lose. Too many questions they don't want asked.

De Vergennes moves down the hall.

He knows the floor plan.

He knows where the safe is supposed to be.

Leclerc takes Malik.

Grip on the arms.

Control.

Professional restraint.

Malik tries to pull away.

The baby oil makes him slippery. Sweat. Panic.

Leclerc holds anyway.

"Don't move," Leclerc says in French.

Malik doesn't listen. He thrashes.

Leclerc applies pressure. Pain compliance. Joint lock.

Malik gasps. Stops struggling.

Thomas speaks to the three men.

"Restez là," he says.

Stay there.

They don't move.

Naked men with money on their breath. Cocaine in their blood. Fear in their eyes.

They understand guns.

They understand command.

They understand consequences.

Tarkovsky watches them. Weapon trained. Finger outside the trigger guard. Professional.

No unnecessary violence. But ready.

De Vergennes returns from the bedroom.

"Closet," he says.

Thomas nods.

They move Malik down the hall. Leclerc half-carrying him. Malik's feet dragging on marble floor.

the house is expensive. Furniture. Art. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the lake.

Money everywhere.

Malik's refuge.

Malik's grave.

They reach the bedroom.

King bed. Silk sheets. More champagne bottles. More evidence of excess.

Closet door opens.

The safe is there.

Big.

Professional.

Black steel. Digital keypad. Bolted down. Reinforced frame.

Not a consumer model.

Military grade.

Malik smiles.

Weak. Desperate.

"Vous pouvez pas," he says.

You can't.

You can't open it. You can't take it. You can't win.

Thomas doesn't answer.

He looks at De Vergennes.

De Vergennes opens his bag.

Breaching charge.

Small.

Precise.

Thermite compound wrapped in plastic. Detonator. Timer.

He kneels at the safe.

He studies it. Runs his fingers along the seams. Checks the bolts. Calculates.

Then he sets putty on steel. Shaped charge. Directional. Focused on the locking mechanism.

Not the whole door.

Just the weak point.

He inserts the detonator. Wires. Timer.

He checks the circuit. Tests the connection.

Thirty seconds.

He stands.

"Back," he says.

They step into the hallway. Close the closet door. Put Malik between them and the charge.

Malik's smile dies.

His face goes pale.

"Wait," he says.

"Too late," Thomas says.

"I have information. I can help you."

"You will. When the safe opens."

"Please."

Thomas doesn't respond.

The timer ticks.

In the living room, the music still plays.

A stupid song.

A stupid beat.

The kind of beat that makes men forget they're mortal.

The kind of beat that makes men think money is power.

It isn't.

Violence is power.

And violence is coming.

Thomas watches Malik.

Malik watches the closed closet door.

Neither man blinks.

Twenty seconds.

Fifteen.

Ten.

Malik's breathing accelerates. Panic. Sweat running down his face.

"You're making a mistake," Malik says.

"I don't make mistakes," Thomas says.

Five seconds.

Thomas turns away. Covers his ears.

The others do the same.

Malik tries to run.

Leclerc holds him.

Zero.

The charge detonates.

Muffled thump. Not loud. Controlled.

Smoke drifts from under the closet door.

The smell of burning metal. Chemical. Sharp.

De Vergennes waits thirty seconds.

Cooling time.

Then he opens the door.

Smoke clears.

The safe door hangs open. Lock melted. Hinges bent.

Inside: darkness.

Thomas steps forward.

This is it.

Everything Malik kept.

Everything Malik valued.

Everything Malik thought would save him.

Documents. Money. Records. Coordinates.

The key to finding Yasmine.

The end of the hunt.

Thomas reaches for the safe.

The contents wait inside.

Ready to speak.

Ready to reveal.

They enter the house.
