# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 10: LOUVRE

The truck is an Iveco panel truck. Heavy construction vehicle. Stolen from a warehouse in Bois-de-Vincennes three days ago. It's been hidden in a garage in the 13th arrondissement. The cargo is loaded inside: four metric tons of TNT. Military-grade explosive. Packed in metal containers. Wired for remote detonation. Yasmine's final message to France.

The driver is a man. Age thirty-four. Name is Karim. He has a wife. Two children. A job at a construction company. A life that was ordinary until Yasmine found him.

Yasmine gave him a choice: die for nothing, or die for something. Die for France to remember.

Karim chose to die for something.

At 2:47 PM on a Wednesday, Karim drives the truck toward the Louvre. The plaza is packed. Spring day. Good weather. Tourists everywhere. School groups. Families. People taking photos of the glass pyramid. The iconic symbol of modern Paris.

The pyramid that represents France's new identity. Modern. Glass. Transparent. Open to the world.

Karim drives at controlled speed. Sixty kilometers per hour. No acceleration. No ramming. Just steady. Just forward.

The brakes are disconnected. Yasmine made sure of that. The accelerator maintains 60 km/h. The steering wheel is lashed to go straight toward the pyramid.

Karim sits in the cab. He's praying. In Arabic. To a God he hasn't spoken to in ten years. But now he's speaking. Now he's asking for forgiveness. Now he's asking for his children to forgive him.

The truck hits the plaza at 60 kilometers per hour.

The pyramid is in the way. The truck doesn't stop. Glass shatters. Metal crumples. The front of the truck caves in. But momentum carries it forward. Into the plaza. Into the crowd.

People are running. People are screaming. People are dying.

The truck slides sideways. It hits a café. It hits a ticket booth. It hits people. So many people.

The explosion comes at 2:48 PM.

Four metric tons of TNT detonate. Remote trigger. Yasmine's finger on the button. The blast is apocalyptic. The plaza ceases to exist. Just fire. Just wind. Just obliteration.

Three hundred meters of damage radius. Four hundred meters at ground zero. Everyone within it is dead. Vaporized. Disintegrated. The blast wave takes buildings blocks away.

The pyramid collapses.

The iconic symbol of Paris falls inward. Implodes. Becomes rubble. The glass shatters into millions of pieces. The metal frame folds like paper. Four metric tons of TNT doesn't leave anything standing.

But this is not the only explosion.

At 2:48 PM, the same second, another Iveco panel truck detonates in front of the Élysée Palace. Four metric tons of TNT. The gates obliterated. The guard detail vaporized. Presidential security compromised. The President's residence is burning.

At 2:48 PM, the same second, a third Iveco panel truck detonates beneath the Eiffel Tower. Four metric tons of TNT. The iron tower shakes. The base is damaged. The structure holds but trembles. The plaza is fire. The tourists are screaming.

Three simultaneous attacks. Three iconic symbols of Paris. Three trucks. Twelve metric tons of TNT. Yasmine's true message.

She didn't attack the metro for transportation. She attacked three symbols of French power. Three messages at the same moment.

By 3:00 PM, the casualty count across all three sites is one thousand two hundred dead. By 3:30 PM, it's one thousand six hundred. By 4:00 PM, it's approaching two thousand.

Hospitals are overwhelmed. Morgues are overwhelmed. Ambulances are turning away dying people because there's nowhere to put them. 

France is burning.

Then comes the report from the Seine.

A barge. Anchored in front of Bercy. A commercial barge. The kind used for transporting materials. It's been there since morning. No one paid attention. Just another river vessel.

But inside: dozens of tons of homemade TNT. Packed into the hull. Covered in gravel to hide the explosives from casual inspection. Professional construction. Precision timing.

At 4:47 PM, the barge detonates.

The blast is biblical. The Seine boils. The water vaporizes. The blast wave travels outward in all directions. Buildings collapse blocks away. The shock wave breaks windows across the entire eastern quarter of Paris.

Bercy is obliterated. The riverside district is gone. Hundreds more dead. Hundreds more injured. The casualty count jumps again.

Total dead from all attacks: three thousand plus.

France has lost more people in four hours than it lost in the entire month of January to any cause.

Thomas is in the command center when the calls start coming in.

"Multiple attacks," the voice says. "Simultaneous. Louvre. Élysée. Eiffel Tower."

Thomas goes very still.

"Three Iveco trucks. Three massive explosions. Two PM forty-eight. All at the same time. Casualties in the thousands. Presidential palace is burning. The tower is damaged. The pyramid is gone."

Thomas doesn't respond. He just listens.

"We're looking at coordinated attacks. We don't know if there are more. We don't know if—"

"Yasmine," Thomas says quietly.

"What?"

"Yasmine. She's still free. She did this. All of it."

The voice on the phone goes silent.

"That's impossible," the voice says. "The catacomb cell is contained. Hassan and Inès are in custody. We have her associates. We have the infrastructure."

"She had backup," Thomas says. "She had other cells. This wasn't one attack. This was coordinated. This was planned from the beginning. The metro was the opening move. This is the real assault."

Thomas is already moving. He's grabbing his coat. He's heading for the door.

"Where are you going?" Moreau asks.

"To the Louvre," Thomas says.

By the time Thomas arrives, the plaza is locked down. Army everywhere. Medical teams. Rescue workers. Forensics. The glass pyramid is gone. Just rubble. Just fire.

And bodies. Hundreds of tourists. Hundreds of school children. Hundreds of ordinary Parisians who just wanted to see the famous pyramid on a Wednesday afternoon.

Thomas walks through the wreckage at the Louvre. He's looking for something. A message. A sign. Something that tells him Yasmine was here.

He finds messages at all three sites. Spray-painted in red. Arabic. French. English.

At the Louvre: "FRANCE REMEMBERS NOW."

At the Élysée: "YOUR LEADERS ARE NOT SAFE."

At the Eiffel Tower: "PARIS BURNS FOR ALGERIA."

And everywhere, the same message repeated in multiple languages:

"ONE THOUSAND ALGERIAN DEAD FOR EVERY DAY OF OCCUPATION.
FRANCE HAS TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO APOLOGIZE FOR COLONIZATION.
AFTER THAT, WE BURN EVERYTHING."

By evening, the final count is confirmed:

Métro 14: 327 dead
Louvre: 478 dead
Élysée: 341 dead
Eiffel Tower: 289 dead
Bercy Barge: 956 dead

TOTAL: 2,391 dead in four hours.

France is no longer hunting a terrorist. France is at war.

Thomas reads it. He understands.

Yasmine isn't going to stop. Karim was the first. There will be others. There will be more trucks. More pyramids. More symbols of France will fall.

Unless Thomas stops her.

By evening, the government is in emergency session. The President is declaring martial law nationwide. The military is mobilizing. Border patrols are being reinforced. Every airport. Every port. Every road.

Yasmine Boudjellal is officially wanted for terrorism. Her face is on every news broadcast.

But she's already gone.

By midnight, Thomas knows this. He's been tracking her movements. The café owner across from the plaza saw a woman leave the area at 2:46 PM. Before the attack. She was filming on her phone. She was documenting.

The woman had a Algerian or North African accent. She was directing people toward and away from the impact zone. She was orchestrating the chaos.

It was Yasmine.

By 6:00 AM the next morning, Thomas has a decision to make.

The government is offering him resources. Everything he needs. Full authority. International cooperation.

But they want to capture her. To bring her to trial. To judge her in a courtroom in Paris.

Thomas doesn't want that. Thomas wants vengeance.

He picks up his phone. He calls Moreau.

"I'm going to find her," Thomas says. "I'm going off the books. I'm not coming back until I find her."

"Where are you going?" Moreau asks.

"Wherever she's going," Thomas says. "She's not French. She's not European. She's from somewhere else. She's going home."

Thomas hangs up.

He gets in the MV Agusta. He leaves Paris. He's heading south. He's heading toward Spain. He's heading toward Morocco.

He doesn't have authorization. He doesn't have backup. He doesn't have anything except the knowledge that Yasmine is out there. And she's not going to stop.

So neither is he.
