# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 10: LOUVRE

The truck is an Iveco. Heavy construction vehicle. Stolen from a warehouse in Bois-de-Vincennes three days ago. It's been hidden in a garage in the 13th arrondissement.

The driver is a man. Age thirty-four. Name is Karim. He has a wife. Two children. A job at a construction company. A life that was ordinary until Yasmine found him.

Yasmine gave him a choice: die for nothing, or die for something. Die for France to remember.

Karim chose to die for something.

At 2:47 PM on a Wednesday, Karim drives the truck toward the Louvre. The plaza is packed. Spring day. Good weather. Tourists everywhere. School groups. Families. People taking photos of the glass pyramid. The iconic symbol of modern Paris.

The pyramid that represents France's new identity. Modern. Glass. Transparent. Open to the world.

Karim drives at controlled speed. Sixty kilometers per hour. No acceleration. No ramming. Just steady. Just forward.

The brakes are disconnected. Yasmine made sure of that. The accelerator maintains 60 km/h. The steering wheel is lashed to go straight toward the pyramid.

Karim sits in the cab. He's praying. In Arabic. To a God he hasn't spoken to in ten years. But now he's speaking. Now he's asking for forgiveness. Now he's asking for his children to forgive him.

The truck hits the plaza at 60 kilometers per hour.

The pyramid is in the way. The truck doesn't stop. Glass shatters. Metal crumples. The front of the truck caves in. But momentum carries it forward. Into the plaza. Into the crowd.

People are running. People are screaming. People are dying.

The truck slides sideways. It hits a café. It hits a ticket booth. It hits people. So many people.

The explosion comes at 2:48 PM.

The truck's fuel tank ruptures. The explosive package detonated by Yasmine remotely. The blast is enormous. The plaza is fire.

Two hundred meters of damage radius. Everyone within it is dead or dying. Glass everywhere. Blood everywhere. Smoke everywhere.

The pyramid collapses.

The iconic symbol of Paris falls inward. Implodes. Becomes rubble.

By 3:00 PM, the casualty count is one hundred forty-seven dead. By 3:30 PM, it's two hundred twelve. By 4:00 PM, it's three hundred eighteen.

Hundreds more are injured. Hundreds more are missing. The identification of bodies will take days.

Thomas is in the command center when he gets the call.

"There's been an attack," the voice says. "The Louvre. A truck. Massive casualties."

Thomas doesn't respond. He just listens.

"The pyramid is destroyed. The plaza is destroyed. We're looking at a coordinated cell attack. We don't know if there are more. We don't know if they're still—"

"Yasmine," Thomas says.

"What?"

"Yasmine. She's still free. She did this."

The voice on the phone goes silent.

"That's impossible," the voice says. "The catacomb cell is contained. Hassan and Inès are in custody. We have her associates. We have the infrastructure."

"She's still free," Thomas says. "The catacomb was a distraction. This is her real attack. This is the escalation."

Thomas is already moving. He's grabbing his coat. He's heading for the door.

"Where are you going?" Moreau asks.

"To the Louvre," Thomas says.

By the time Thomas arrives, the plaza is locked down. Army everywhere. Medical teams. Rescue workers. Forensics. The glass pyramid is gone. Just rubble. Just fire.

And bodies. Hundreds of tourists. Hundreds of school children. Hundreds of ordinary Parisians who just wanted to see the famous pyramid on a Wednesday afternoon.

Thomas walks through the wreckage. He's looking for something. A message. A sign. Something that tells him Yasmine was here.

He finds it on the café wall. Spray-painted in red. Arabic. French. English.

"FRANCE REMEMBERS NOW.
ONE THOUSAND ALGERIAN DEAD FOR EVERY DAY OF OCCUPATION.
THIS IS THE BEGINNING."

Thomas reads it. He understands.

Yasmine isn't going to stop. Karim was the first. There will be others. There will be more trucks. More pyramids. More symbols of France will fall.

Unless Thomas stops her.

By evening, the government is in emergency session. The President is declaring martial law nationwide. The military is mobilizing. Border patrols are being reinforced. Every airport. Every port. Every road.

Yasmine Boudjellal is officially wanted for terrorism. Her face is on every news broadcast.

But she's already gone.

By midnight, Thomas knows this. He's been tracking her movements. The café owner across from the plaza saw a woman leave the area at 2:46 PM. Before the attack. She was filming on her phone. She was documenting.

The woman had a Algerian or North African accent. She was directing people toward and away from the impact zone. She was orchestrating the chaos.

It was Yasmine.

By 6:00 AM the next morning, Thomas has a decision to make.

The government is offering him resources. Everything he needs. Full authority. International cooperation.

But they want to capture her. To bring her to trial. To judge her in a courtroom in Paris.

Thomas doesn't want that. Thomas wants vengeance.

He picks up his phone. He calls Moreau.

"I'm going to find her," Thomas says. "I'm going off the books. I'm not coming back until I find her."

"Where are you going?" Moreau asks.

"Wherever she's going," Thomas says. "She's not French. She's not European. She's from somewhere else. She's going home."

Thomas hangs up.

He gets in the MV Agusta. He leaves Paris. He's heading south. He's heading toward Spain. He's heading toward Morocco.

He doesn't have authorization. He doesn't have backup. He doesn't have anything except the knowledge that Yasmine is out there. And she's not going to stop.

So neither is he.
