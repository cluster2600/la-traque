# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 34: ZUG FINANCE

Malik Benhadj is in Zug.

Switzerland. The finance capital. The place where money moves quietly. The place where people hide money. The place where questions aren't asked.

Malik is a financial operator. He built the bombs. He coordinated the logistics. He managed the money. He made the operation possible.

He escaped through Belgium. Then Germany. Then Poland. Then Turkey. Then Istanbul. Then a boat to Algeria. But Algeria wasn't safe. The DGSE was hunting. The borders were closing. The net was tightening.

So Malik kept moving. South to Morocco. Then east. Then north again. Then eventually to Switzerland. Zug. The safest place in the world for a man with money and no questions.

He's in a bank. A private bank. The kind that handles accounts for people who don't want governments knowing about their money.

The banker is discreet. The banker asks no questions. The banker simply manages the account. Eight million euros. Yasmine's cut. The cell's remaining funds. The money Hassan left for contingency.

Malik is withdrawing it. Slowly. Carefully. In amounts that don't trigger alarms. In ways that don't attract attention.

He's moving the money to a new account. A new identity. A new life. In a place where the DGSE can't reach. Where the French government can't find him. Where he can disappear forever.

Malik sits in the bank office. The banker slides the document across the desk.

"Twenty thousand euros," the banker says. "Cash transfer, as requested. No documentation. No trace."

Malik nods. He takes the envelope. He checks the contents. Twenty thousand euros. Clean. Untraceable. Perfect.

"How much longer?" the banker asks.

"Another month," Malik says. "By then, it will all be distributed. All of it. Every euro."

"And then?" the banker asks.

"Then I disappear."

The banker nods. He understands. He's handled this before. Men with money and secrets and hunted pasts. Men who need to vanish. Men who need to survive.

"The account will be closed," the banker says. "No trace. No record. As if it never existed."

Malik leaves the bank. He walks through the streets of Zug. The city is clean. The streets are quiet. The people are wealthy and discreet. Nobody looks at him. Nobody cares who he is.

He's safe here. For now. As long as the money flows. As long as he stays quiet. As long as nobody finds out that he's in Switzerland.

But the DGSE knows about Zug. They know about banks. They know about money. They know that men with secrets often hide in places where money moves quietly.

The DGSE has a team in Zug. They're watching the banks. They're watching the private accounts. They're watching for unusual transfers. They're watching for Malik.

And they find him.

Not in the bank. But at his apartment. A small, clean apartment. Anonymous. The kind of place a man rents when he doesn't want to be found.

The team arrives at night. Swiss police. DGSE liaison officers. They don't bother with questions.

They arrest Malik Benhadj.

Eight million euros seized. The money frozen. The accounts closed. The escape plan destroyed.

Malik doesn't resist. He's professional. He understands. The hunt caught up with him.

He's transported to France. To a detention center. To interrogation. To the understanding that his escape has failed. That the money won't save him. That Switzerland was never safe enough.

In a basement interrogation room in Paris, Malik is questioned.

He gives up locations. Safe houses. Escape routes. Cell communications. Everything. Because the money is gone. Because the escape is impossible. Because there's nothing left to protect.

He gives up Tadrart.

"Hassan's cousin has a house," Malik says. "In Tadrart. Sahara. Small village. Stone house on the south side. That's where she went. That's where she's waiting."

The interrogator writes it down. Malik has just signed Yasmine's death warrant. He doesn't know it. He doesn't care. He's thinking about the ten years in a French prison. He's thinking about the rest of his life in confinement.

He's thinking about the eight million euros that are now in a government vault. Money that was supposed to save him. Money that couldn't save him. Money that was just paper at the end.

Outside the interrogation room, the DGSE officers confirm the intelligence.

Tadrart. A small village. A stone house. Yasmine waiting.

The final piece of the puzzle. The final location. The final hunt can begin.
