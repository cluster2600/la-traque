# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 33: COORDINATES

Thomas reads the documents in the safe house.

Not in Zug.

Not in Switzerland.

In a rented apartment across the border. French side. Annemasse. Twenty minutes from Geneva.

Deniable.

Safer.

Legal jurisdiction clear.

De Vergennes spread the contents on a table.

Gold bags. Heavy. Unmarked.

Diamond pouches. Small stones. High quality. Portable wealth.

Bond certificates. Bearer bonds. Swiss issue. Untraceable.

Cash bricks. Euros. Dollars. Swiss francs.

And the folder.

The folder matters more.

Because money is just fuel.

Information is direction.

Thomas opens it again.

Handwritten notes. Malik's handwriting. Cramped. Nervous.

Arabic names.

French translations.

Contact information. Phone numbers. Email addresses.

A map sketched with a shaky pen. Algerian south. Village marked with an X.

A set of coordinates.

Latitude: 24.8731° N

Longitude: 8.4422° E

A village name.

TADRART.

And a note: "Y safe house. Hassan arranged. Touareg protection. Remote."

Y.

Yasmine.

Thomas stares at it.

This is confirmation.

Not speculation.

Not hypothesis.

Proof.

Beaumont leans over.

"It's real," he says. "Algerian south. Sahara edge. Tassili n'Ajjer region."

Moreau checks it against imagery.

Laptop open.

Satellite tiles load.

A small cluster of buildings. Maybe twenty structures total.

One stone house on the edge of the village.

Isolated. Separate from the others.

Movement visible in the imagery.

Two figures. Servants.

Someone inside.

Heat signature at night. One person.

Thomas stares at the screen.

This is it.

All the Mediterranean chases.

All the dead ends.

All the interviews.

All the money trails.

All the eliminations.

It points to one stone house.

One woman.

One target.

Tarkovsky speaks.

"We go," he says.

Thomas doesn't answer yet.

He studies the map. The terrain. The distances.

Tadrart is remote. No airport. No roads worth mentioning. No government presence.

Touareg territory. Nomad law. French colonial history makes cooperation unlikely.

Algeria doesn't forgive. Algeria doesn't forget.

This will be difficult.

Dangerous.

Final.

He calls the Director.

Secure line. Encryption. Scrambler.

The Director answers on the second ring.

"You have something," the Director says.

Not a question.

"Coordinates," Thomas says. "Tadrart. Algeria. Malik kept documents. He wrote it down."

Silence.

Then the Director breathes out.

Long. Heavy.

"You understand the political risk," the Director says.

"I understand," Thomas says.

"Algeria is not Switzerland. Algeria is not Portugal. If you go in, you go in dark. No official presence. No backup. No extraction if things go wrong."

"I understand."

"If you're caught, France denies you. Publicly. Completely. We can't protect you diplomatically."

"Privately?"

Pause.

"Privately, we do everything we can. Legal defense. Back channels. But you need to stay clean. No civilians. No firefights with Algerian military. No bodies on roads. You go in. You complete the mission. You get out. Ghost operation."

"Understood."

"You will need local cover," the Director says. "Touareg guides. Desert routes. Off-grid insertion. No air assets. No satellites during the operation. We can't risk detection."

"We already have contacts," Thomas says. Beaumont's network. North African operatives. Touareg smugglers who work for cash.

"Then I will authorize it," the Director says. "Executive authorization. Written. Sealed. Presidential approval. Only you see it."

Thomas hears the click.

This matters.

He stays inside mandate.

He stays official.

Even when the world never knows.

Even when France denies publicly.

Authorization protects him privately.

Full legal cover. Full resources. Full deniability.

The best operational position.

"One more thing," the Director says.

"Yes?"

"Switzerland. Malik. You keep it contained. No diplomatic incident. No media exposure."

Thomas looks at the money on the table.

"Contained," Thomas says.

He doesn't mention the wealth.

He doesn't mention the body disposed in the lake. Weighted. Sunk. Gone.

He doesn't mention the Swiss police who never arrived. Who never asked questions.

He doesn't need to.

The Director doesn't ask.

That's how authorization works at this level.

Quiet. Clean. Deniable.

Thomas hangs up.

He turns to the team.

"We split," he says.

"How?" Beaumont asks.

"One element cleans Switzerland. Erases traces. Extracts assets to Paris channels. Closes accounts. Removes evidence."

He looks at De Vergennes.

"You handle that with Richelieu," Thomas says.

De Vergennes nods.

"Second element prepares Algeria," Thomas continues.

He looks at Moreau.

"You coordinate comms and imagery. I need real-time satellite coverage until we go dark. Then I need exfiltration routes planned. Emergency protocols."

He looks at Tarkovsky and Leclerc.

"You prep gear. Desert kit. Water. Navigation. Suppressed weapons. Night vision. Medical supplies."

He looks at Beaumont.

"You contact Touareg guides. I need insertion routes. Local knowledge. Deniable transport."

No speeches.

No promises.

Just tasks.

Operators nod. They understand their roles.

Thomas folds the coordinates and puts them in his pocket.

The paper is thin. Light.

But it weighs heavy.

This is the end of the hunt.

This is where Yasmine dies.

In the Sahara, a young woman waits in a stone house.

She thinks the world forgot her.

The world didn't.

It just took time to find her.

Time to eliminate the others.

Time to extract intelligence.

Time to position assets.

Now the time is over.

The map is drawn.

The route is set.

The authorization is granted.

And the next chapter is already written.

Zug ends.

Tadrart begins.

Thomas looks at the coordinates one more time.

24.8731° N, 8.4422° E

Numbers on a page.

Death sentence for a woman in a stone house.

Justice for a man burned in a tunnel.

Vengeance for a friend named Jérôme.

Thomas puts the paper away.

"Pack out," he says. "We move in forty-eight hours."

The team disperses.

De Vergennes and Richelieu to Zug. Clean the scene. Extract the wealth.

Moreau to the communications hub. Satellite coordination.

Tarkovsky and Leclerc to the equipment cache. Desert preparation.

Beaumont to make calls. Touareg contacts. Smuggler routes. Desert guides who don't ask questions.

Thomas stays in the safe house.

Alone.

He looks at the map one more time.

Red X over Palermo. Tunis. Lisbon. Zug.

Red circle over Tadrart.

Five targets.

Four eliminated.

One remaining.

The primary target.

The cell leader.

The woman who planned the attack.

The woman who killed Jérôme.

Thomas closes the folder.

Outside, France sleeps.

Unaware.

Protected.

Safe because men like Thomas do what's necessary.

In the shadows.

Without recognition.

Without glory.

Just mission completion.

The hunt is almost over.

One more target.

One more elimination.

One more stone house in the desert.

And then it's done.

Thomas turns off the lights.

He leaves the safe house.

Tomorrow, preparation.

In two days, insertion.

In three days, Tadrart.

The final chapter approaches.
