# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 33: COORDINATES

The Airbnb in Evian overlooks Lake Geneva.

Tourist property. Lake view. Vacation rental anonymity. Keys left under the mat. Booking confirmation in a false name. Perfect operational security.

Thomas sits at the kitchen table. Files spread before him. The contents of Malik's safe. Gold bars wrapped in their original packaging. Diamonds in velvet pouches. Bearer bonds in sleeves. Cash in organized stacks.

And the deed.

The property deed sits in the center of the table. Swiss document. Official. Registered. Legal.

Thomas reads it slowly.

The house belongs to a Swiss trust. A Cayman Islands trust registered in Geneva. Anonymous ownership on the surface. But the deed itself names the beneficiary.

Malik Benhadj.

And secondary authority: Hassan Medjahed.

Both documented. Both named. Both guilty by paper.

Thomas turns the page.

Property description:

"Residential dwelling. Stone construction. Single story. Located at coordinates 24.8731° North, 8.4422° East. Village of Tadrart, Tassili n'Ajjer region, southeastern Algeria. Purpose: residential refuge. Remote location. Local Touareg contacts established for security and logistics."

Purchase date: Seven years ago.

Before the operation. Before the attack. Before the hunt.

Malik bought this property years in advance. He prepared it. He documented it. He kept the deed in his safe in Zug.

And now Thomas has it.

De Vergennes enters with a tactical map. No laptop. No satellite imagery.

"We have the coordinates," De Vergennes says. "That's all we get from the safe. Everything else is dead reckoning and Touareg intelligence."

Thomas studies the map. Tadrart marked with a pencil X.

"How do we move on this?" Thomas asks.

Leclerc enters with a folder. Maritime logistics. Shipping schedules.

"The Forbin leaves Toulon tomorrow," Leclerc says. "Fregate porte-hélicoptères. Official mission: anti-piracy patrol off the coast of Mali. Which means it's close to the Algerian border. Close enough."

Thomas nods. He knows how this works. Official cover. Deniable operations. The Navy has helicopters. The Navy has reach.

"Timeline," Thomas says.

"Three days to the Forbin staging area," Leclerc says. "Two days to position off the coast. One day for final reconnaissance. Then we go."

Beaumont leans over the map.

"Six days," Beaumont says. "She doesn't move for six days, she's ours."

"She moves," Thomas says, "we lose her."

"The Touareg will report any departure," De Vergennes says. "Hassan established those contacts years ago. Anyone leaving Tadrart, we hear about it within hours."

Thomas sets the deed on the table.

"She's been there the whole time," Thomas says. "Hiding in a house that Malik bought seven years ago. A house documented in his safe. A house he thought was secure."

"It was secure," Beaumont says. "Until you opened the safe."

Thomas nods.

"The safe was the vulnerability," Thomas continues. "Malik kept records for insurance. Records of every property, every contact, every location. He thought documentation meant protection. He was wrong."

Tarkovsky studies the map.

"Distance from coast to Tadrart," Tarkovsky says. "Two hundred kilometers inland. Deep desert. No roads. Only air insertion works."

"The Forbin carries Super Puma helicopters," Leclerc says. "One is enough. We stage at sea. Wait for the Touareg confirmation that she's still there. Then we fly."

"Six days," Thomas repeats.

"Six days," Leclerc confirms.

Thomas picks up the deed. Reads the coordinates again.

24.8731° North.

8.4422° East.

Six days away by helicopter.

From Evian to Tadrart. From a Swiss deed to a Saharan house. From Malik's safe to Yasmine's refuge.

The trail is complete.

The coordinates are exact.

The location is confirmed.

The operation is ready.

But not for six days.

Six days is an eternity in tactical operations. Six days is time for her to move. Time for her to run. Time for her to disappear into the desert.

Unless the Touareg hold her there. Unless Hassan's contacts keep her in place. Unless she believes she's safe.

Thomas reads the handwritten note in the deed margin again.

"Y refuge. Emergency only. Hassan coordinates. Yasmine knows location. Use if operation compromised."

Malik had always known. He had always prepared. He had always documented.

And Yasmine. Yasmine was waiting. Still in the house. Still believing it was safe. Still not knowing that Hassan's contacts weren't loyal to Hassan anymore. Not knowing that the DGSE had sources in the desert. Not knowing that six days was enough time to watch. To prepare. To execute.

Thomas picks up the deed and reads the final line.

A handwritten note in the margin. Malik's handwriting. Shaky. Written years ago.

"Y refuge. Emergency only. Hassan coordinates. Yasmine knows location. Use if operation compromised."

So Malik had always known. He had always prepared. He had always documented.

And his documentation became the map that led to her death.

In the Airbnb overlooking Lake Geneva, Thomas folds the deed carefully.

Tomorrow he flies south. Tomorrow the Super Puma takes off. Tomorrow the operation begins.

Yasmine is waiting in the Sahara.

She doesn't know about the deed.

She doesn't know about the safe.

She doesn't know that Malik's insurance policy is about to kill her.

She just waits in a stone house on the edge of a village. In the coordinates documented in a Swiss deed. In the refuge prepared seven years in advance.

And Thomas has the map.
