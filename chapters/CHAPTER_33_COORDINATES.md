# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 33: COORDINATES

### 06:00 — Annemasse Safe House

Thomas reads the deed.

Swiss document. Official. Registered. Legal.

The property belongs to a Cayman Islands trust. Anonymous on the surface. But the deed names the beneficiary.

Malik Benhadj.

Secondary authority: Hassan Medjahed.

Both documented. Both named. Both guilty by paper.

Thomas turns the page.

Property description:

"Residential dwelling. Stone construction. Single story. Located at coordinates 24.8731° North, 8.4422° East. Village of Tadrart, Tassili n'Ajjer region, southeastern Algeria. Purpose: residential refuge. Remote location. Local Touareg contacts established for security and logistics."

Purchased seven years ago.

Before the operation. Before the attack. Before the hunt.

Malik prepared this. Documented it. Kept the deed in his safe in Zug.

And now Thomas has it.

The coordinates are exact.

The location is confirmed.

Yasmin is there.

De Vergennes enters with the tactical assessment.

"DGSE has Touareg contacts in the region," he says. "One message confirms presence. Woman matching description, single story stone house, coordinates confirmed."

Thomas nods.

"Timeline," he says.

"Military airlift standing by," De Vergennes says. "Falcon from Lyon airbase. Two-hour flight to Toulon. Super Puma helicopter from the Forbin. Ready when we are."

Thomas sets down the deed.

"Assemble the team," he says. "We move now."

### 08:00 — Leave for Lyon Airbase

Two black rental cars. No markings.

They drive from Annemasse toward Lyon. Route: A42 north → A89 east → Lyon.

120 kilometers. Two hours.

Thomas drives. Tarkovsky in passenger seat. Leclerc, De Vergennes, Beaumont in back. Weapons secured. Minimal luggage. Operational gear only.

The second car follows. Moreau driving. Four additional operatives.

Two vehicles. Sixteen operatives total. The full extraction team.

They don't speak. The hunt is ending. The coordinates are exact. Yasmin is trapped in a house 2,000 kilometers south, in the Sahara desert, believing she's safe.

She has no idea the deed is in Thomas's hands.

She has no idea Hassan's insurance policy is about to kill her.

They drive through the morning. No speeding. No attention. Professional.

### 10:15 — Lyon Airbase

Military facility. Secure. Restricted.

But the credentials are perfect. Bureau des Légendes legends. Real military papers. Real authorization.

The guard waves them through.

They park in the secured hangar.

The Falcon is waiting.

French military jet. Dassault. Twin-engine. Fast. Operational.

Falcon 900. Perfect for tactical deployment.

The pilot is DGSE. The co-pilot is DGSE. The loadmaster is DGSE.

This is an official operation. Deniable, but official.

Thomas boards first. His team follows.

Sixteen operatives. Weapons, tactical gear, minimal baggage. They fit in the Falcon's cabin.

Doors close.

Engines spool up.

No ATC chatter. Military priority. Direct routing.

### 10:45 — Airborne, Falcon 900

Two-hour flight to Toulon.

Thomas sits by the window. Deed in his hands. Coordinates written on his palm in pencil.

24.8731° North.

8.4422° East.

Tadrart. Stone house. Single story.

Yasmin waiting.

De Vergennes reads tactical maps. Super Puma capabilities. Helicopter insertion. Desert landing zones. Security perimeter.

Leclerc checks weapons for the last time. Glock. Suppressor. Magazine. Chamber.

Tarkovsky studies satellite imagery. Heat signatures. Building layout. Approach vectors.

The hunt is converging.

The coordinates are exact.

The operation is ready.

No speech needed. They've trained for this. They know what comes next.

### 12:45 — Toulon Naval Base

The Falcon descends into French naval airspace.

Toulon approaches.

Mediterranean coast. Naval base. Secure.

The Falcon lands on the military runway.

Doors open.

A DGSE liaison meets them with transport.

"The Forbin is ready," the liaison says. "Boarding immediately. She's heading Atlantic. Full tactical crew. Helicopter department on standby."

Thomas nods.

They load into a black truck. No identification. No markings.

Fifteen minutes to the dock.

### 13:00 — Toulon Port

The Forbin sits at the dock.

Frégate porte-hélicoptères. Helicopter carrier. 6,000 tons. French Navy insignia.

Official mission: anti-piracy patrol, Atlantic coast.

Real purpose: extraction operation in Sahara.

The crew is waiting.

Captain Gerard salutes Thomas. Professional. Military. No questions asked.

"Welcome aboard, monsieur," the captain says. "Your quarters are ready. Flight deck prepared for the Super Puma. Crew briefed on the operation."

Thomas nods.

"Timeline," he says.

"We sail in one hour," Captain Gerard says. "20-hour transit to the launch point. By tomorrow evening, we're positioned off the Algerian coast. Close enough for helicopter insertion into Tadrart."

Thomas looks at the deed one more time.

24.8731° North.

8.4422° East.

One day away.

### 13:15 — Forbin Boarding

Thomas leads his team up the gangway.

Sailors stand at attention. Professional. Military. The nature of the operation is classified.

They don't ask questions.

The captain escorts Thomas to the command center. Maps of the Atlantic. Tactical displays. Operational planning room.

A secure briefing room. Locked door. DGSE oversight.

Thomas spreads the deed on the table.

Captain Gerard studies it.

"Exact coordinates," Gerard says. "We can put the Super Puma down within 200 meters. Desert landing. Four-minute flight from the coast."

De Vergennes points at the satellite imagery.

"Single structure. Stone. Isolated. No visible threats. One or two personnel inside."

Leclerc studies the terrain.

"Approach from the southwest," Leclerc says. "Wind direction is favorable. Landing zone is hard-packed sand. No obstacles."

Thomas looks at the maps.

"Timeline," he says.

"Eighteen hours to position," Gerard says. "Two hours preparation. Then insertion."

Thomas nods.

The hunt is ending.

Yasmin is waiting in a stone house on the edge of the Sahara.

She doesn't know the deed is in Thomas's hands.

She doesn't know Hassan's insurance policy is about to kill her.

She doesn't know that the Forbin is heading Atlantic.

She doesn't know that in eighteen hours, a Super Puma will descend from the desert sky.

She just waits in the coordinates documented in a Swiss trust.

And Thomas has the map.

### 14:00 — Forbin Anchors

Moorings release.

Engines engage.

The Forbin pushes away from Toulon dock.

Slow. Professional. Military precision.

The Atlantic is waiting.

The desert is waiting.

Yasmin is waiting.

Thomas stands on the bridge and watches Toulon fade.

The hunt is ending.

The coordinates are exact.

The operation is ready.

Tomorrow night, the Super Puma takes off.

Tomorrow night, Yasmin dies.

Tonight, they sail.

The Atlantic opens before them.

Direction: the Sahara.

Destination: death.
