# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 31: ZUG EYES

Thomas gathers the team at 17:30 in the safe house near the casino. The floor plan is spread on the table. Seestrasse 47. Modern building. Glass and steel. The kind of architecture that costs millions and announces nothing.

"Malik is already home," De Vergennes says. "Alone. Setting up for guests."

"Entry at 23:00," Thomas says. "When the house is full. Downstairs noise covers everything."

De Vergennes checks his tools. Pry bar. Crowbar. Bolt cutters. Industrial steel. No explosives. No sabotage. Just force.

"The safe is bolted to the floor. We open it manually. Twenty minutes. In and out."

Beaumont sits with the police scanner. Headset. Encrypted frequency. He watches the monitor that shows Swiss patrol routes.

"Patrol cycle is forty minutes," Beaumont says. "Last one passed at 22:00. Next one at 23:40. We have a fifty-minute window."

Thomas studies the dock entrance on the floor plan. South side. Water access. No street cameras. No witnesses.

The team assembles gear. Weapons checked. Suppressors on. Magazine loads verified. Gloves. Nothing that leaves a trace.

By 22:15, they're ready.

### 22:30 — The Lake

Two DGSE service cars parked a kilometer away.

They move through Zug's quiet streets on foot. Four operatives. Minimal gear. Weapons secured. Professional silence.

The night is cold. February air coming off the lake smells like diesel fuel and expensive concrete. Lights from lakeside homes reflect on the water. Nobody awake. Nobody watching.

They reach the dock at 22:58.

The water is black. Empty. Seestrasse 47 glows across the lake. Third floor lit. Music barely audible from this distance. Malik's party starting. Voices. Laughter. Women.

Thomas checks his watch. 22:58.

Beaumont's voice in the earpiece: "Patrol just passed. Forty-minute window open."

Thomas moves toward the dock door.

### 23:00 — Into the Night

De Vergennes forces the dock door in eight seconds. Aluminum frame. Glass panel. The sound of breaking glass is swallowed by the music upstairs.

The hallway is dark. Cold. Concrete smell. They move upstairs. Fast. Silent. Glock in hand. Suppressor. Chamber loaded.

They reach the third floor.

The bedroom door is unlocked.

Thomas enters.
