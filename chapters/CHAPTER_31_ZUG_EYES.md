# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 31: ZUG EYES

Zug is quiet.

Rich quiet.

The kind of quiet that means no one wants trouble.

The city sits on the lake. Mountains in the distance. Clean streets. Expensive cars. Not banks. Just money. Silent money. Sleeping money.

Switzerland. Where wealth doesn't announce itself.

Thomas arrives with his team in three Mercedes wagons.

Big cars. Not new. Not old. Five years old. E-Class. Diesel engines. Practical. Professional. Invisible.

French plates. Real plates. Attached to identities created by the Bureau des Légendes. Real names. Real paperwork. Real business registration in Lyon. Everything legal. Everything checked.

The Bureau des Légendes created the legend. The fake identity. The consulting firm. The business registration. The tax files. The bank accounts. Everything traceable. Everything real.

The three wagons take different routes into Zug. They park near the lake. They unload equipment. Surveillance gear. Weapons cases. Safe house supplies.

They look like French business people moving into temporary accommodations.

They look like normal.

They look like the legend.

They take a safe house thirty minutes from the lake.

Apartment rented under the Bureau des Légendes cover company. Legal. Officially a consulting firm. French business operating in Switzerland. Paperwork perfect.

Switzerland doesn't ask questions when paperwork is correct.

When the legend is solid.

When everything is registered and taxed.

Beaumont and Richelieu take surveillance.

They sit in a parked van with tinted windows. Cameras. Long lenses. Directional microphones.

They watch Seestrasse 47.

Modern building. Glass and steel. Underground parking. Lake view.

Expensive.

They watch the door.

They watch the dock behind it.

They watch Malik.

He appears at 9:12 AM.

Gym bag. Tracksuit. Soft body. Pale skin. The look of a man who spends time indoors.

He walks like a man who believes in safety.

He doesn't scan.

He doesn't check reflections.

He doesn't do countersurveillance.

He thinks Switzerland is armor.

He thinks wealth is protection.

He thinks geography is safety.

Beaumont whispers into the radio.

"Target visual."

Thomas listens from the safe house.

He doesn't move yet.

He wants pattern.

He wants certainty.

For three days they watch.

Malik leaves at 9:00 AM. Gym. Returns at 11:00 AM. Shower. Lunch at noon. Local café. Pasta. Wine. Espresso.

Afternoon walk by the lake. Sits on a bench. Feeds ducks. Watches boats.

Returns at 4:00 PM. Stays inside until evening.

Groceries on Tuesday and Thursday. Same store. Same routine.

Predictable.

Safe.

Arrogant.

Then Friday.

At 6:00 PM, a delivery arrives.

Van. Catering company. Logo on the side.

Alcohol.

Food.

At 7:30 PM, three cars arrive. Expensive. Audi. BMW. Mercedes.

Men in suits. Women in dresses. Laughter. Music starts inside.

By 8:00 PM, the house is loud.

Music.

Laughter.

The sound of a man spending blood money.

The sound of a man who thinks he escaped.

Thomas gathers the team.

He lays the plan on the table. Floor plan of the building. Marked with entry points. Exit routes. Sight lines.

"Lake side entry," Thomas says. "Two operators on the street. Beaumont and Richelieu. You watch for Swiss police. You watch for civilians. You give us twenty minutes."

Beaumont nods.

"Four through the dock. Me. Tarkovsky. De Vergennes. Leclerc. We enter from the lake. We move through the house. We secure Malik. We open the safe. We extract documents and assets."

"Time limit?" Tarkovsky asks.

"Twenty minutes. In and out. Clean."

"And if Swiss police arrive?"

"We abort. We scatter. We meet at the secondary safe house in France."

Tarkovsky nods. He likes clear parameters.

"No Swiss police," Thomas says. "No civilians hurt unless they force it. We keep it quiet. We get Malik. We get the safe. We leave."

De Vergennes nods.

He has breaching charges in a bag. Small. Precise. Thermite compound. Military grade.

Just enough to open a safe without collapsing a building.

"The safe is in the bedroom closet," De Vergennes says. "Large. Professional. Bolted to the floor. Thirty seconds to breach. Thirty seconds to cool. Then we extract."

Moreau checks comms from the van.

Encrypted radios. Short range. No cellular. No digital trail.

Police scanner monitoring local frequencies.

"Swiss police cycles every forty minutes," Moreau reports. "Last pass was twenty minutes ago. Next pass in twenty minutes."

Perfect window.

Leclerc checks medical kit.

Tourniquets. Syringes. Morphine. Tape. Hemostatic gauze.

He doesn't expect to use it.

But he checks anyway.

Professionals always prepare.

Tarkovsky checks his Glock.

Suppressor. Magazine. Slide. Chamber.

He doesn't think about morality.

He doesn't think about law.

He thinks about angles.

Lines of sight.

Threat assessment.

Who dies first if violence starts.

At 10:30 PM, Beaumont reports.

"Swiss patrol passed. Next cycle forty minutes."

Thomas stands.

"Move," he says.

They leave the safe house.

Two cars.

Black.

Unmarked.

Rental plates.

They park a kilometer away. Side street. No cameras.

They walk to the lake.

Night air. Water smell. Rich people sleeping.

Lights in windows. Boats rocking gently at docks.

Normal Swiss night.

Beautiful.

Peaceful.

About to be violated.

The dock is empty.

the house glows with light on the third floor.

Figures move behind glass.

Music thumps. Bass line. American pop song.

Malik's silhouette.

A fat man laughing.

A man who thinks he's safe.

Thomas waits in the shadow.

The operation is ready.

The target is present.

The safe is upstairs.

The documents are inside.

Intelligence. Coordinates. Financial records.

Everything Thomas needs to find Yasmine.

The end of Malik begins now.

But the trigger hasn't been pulled yet.

Not in this chapter.

In this moment, they're still ghosts on a Swiss lake.

Still quiet.

Still unseen.

Just shadows among other shadows.

Thomas looks at his watch. 10:43 PM.

He looks at his team. Tarkovsky. Leclerc. De Vergennes.

Professionals.

Killers.

Operators who understand the mission.

He nods once.

They move toward the building.

Silent.

Purposeful.

Final.

A breath before violence.

The moment before Zug becomes a crime scene.

The moment before Switzerland's neutrality gets tested.

The moment before Malik realizes that money doesn't buy safety.

It just buys time.

And Malik's time is over.
