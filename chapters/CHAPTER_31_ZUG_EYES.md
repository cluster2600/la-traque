# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 31: ZUG EYES

### 18:00 — Safe House, Zug

Zug is quiet.

Rich quiet. The kind of quiet that means no one wants trouble. The city sits on the lake. Mountains in the distance. Clean streets. Expensive cars. Not banks. Just money. Silent money. Sleeping money.

Switzerland. Where wealth doesn't announce itself.

Thomas arrives with the team in three Mercedes E-Class wagons. Five years old. Diesel engines. Practical. Professional. Invisible.

French plates. Real plates. Real identities created by the Bureau des Légendes. Everything traceable. Everything legal.

They park near the lake. Unload surveillance gear. Weapons cases. Safe house supplies. They look like French business people moving into temporary accommodations.

The safe house: three minutes from the lake. Near the casino. Where money moves quietly and wealthy men don't ask questions.

Apartment rented under Bureau cover. Consulting firm. French business operating in Switzerland. Paperwork perfect.

Switzerland doesn't ask questions when paperwork is correct.

When the legend is solid.

When everything is registered and taxed.

Beaumont and Richelieu take surveillance positions.

Tinted van. Parked across from Seestrasse 47. Cameras. Long lenses. Directional microphones.

They watch the door.

They watch the dock.

They wait for the target.

### 18:30 — Seestrasse 47

The building is modern. Glass and steel. Underground parking. Lake view. Expensive.

Catering van arrives. Alcohol. Food. The smell of money spending itself.

By 19:00, Malik is home.

Preparing. Changing clothes. Getting ready.

### 18:45 — Safe House, Zug

Thomas gathers the team around the floor plan.

Seestrasse 47. Modern building. Three floors. Underground parking. Dock access on the south side.

"Beaumont and Richelieu watch the street," Thomas says. "Police scanner. You give us twenty minutes."

Beaumont nods.

"Four of us entry from the lake. Me. Tarkovsky. De Vergennes. Leclerc."

He points at the floor plan.

"Dock entrance. Ground floor. Stairs to the bedroom. Third floor. Safe is in the closet. De Vergennes breaches. We secure the target. We extract."

"Time limit?" Tarkovsky asks.

"Twenty minutes. In and out. Clean."

"Swiss police?" De Vergennes asks.

"Last patrol was 18:00. Next cycle in forty minutes. We're inside the window."

De Vergennes checks his breaching kit. Small charges. Thermite compound. Military grade. Just enough to open a safe without collapsing a building.

"Safe is bolted to the floor," he says. "Thirty seconds to breach. Thirty seconds to cool. Then we extract."

Moreau monitors police frequencies from the van.

Encrypted radios. Short range. No cellular. No digital trail.

Leclerc checks medical kit.

Tourniquets. Syringes. Morphine. Tape. Hemostatic gauze.

He doesn't expect to use it.

But professionals always prepare.

Tarkovsky checks his Glock.

Suppressor. Magazine. Slide. Chamber.

He doesn't think about morality.

He doesn't think about law.

He thinks about angles.

Lines of sight.

Who dies first if violence starts.

### 19:15 — Beaumont's Van, Seestrasse 47

Three cars arrive at Seestrasse 47. Audi. BMW. Mercedes.

Men in suits. Women in dresses. Laughter. The sound of a man celebrating something.

Beaumont whispers into the radio.

"Target visual. Party starting. Guests arriving."

Thomas listens from the safe house.

"How many civilians?"

"Seven. Maybe eight. Drunk. Not observant."

"Police?"

"Clean. Last patrol thirty minutes ago. Next cycle in twenty."

Thomas nods once.

### 19:20 — The Lake, Zug

They leave the safe house in two black rental cars.

Unmarked. Rental plates. No distinguishing marks.

They park a kilometer away. Side street. No cameras.

They walk to the lake.

Night air. Water smell. Boats rocking at docks. Lights in windows. Rich people settling into evening.

Normal Swiss night.

Beautiful.

Peaceful.

About to be violated.

Thomas checks his watch. 19:25.

Five minutes until the police patrol passes.

Five minutes until they move.

The dock is empty.

The house glows with light on the third floor.

Figures move behind glass.

Music thumps. Bass line. American pop song.

Malik's silhouette.

55 years old. 150 kilos. Heavy man laughing. Surrounded by young women. Surrounded by stolen money.

A man who thinks he's safe.

Thomas looks at his team.

Tarkovsky. Leclerc. De Vergennes.

Professionals.

Operators who understand the mission.

He nods once.

### 19:28 — Beaumont's Van

Beaumont whispers into the radio.

"Swiss patrol passing now. You have forty minutes."

Thomas doesn't answer.

He moves toward the dock.

Silent.

Purposeful.

Final.

### 19:30 — Seestrasse 47, Ground Floor

They breach the dock door. Aluminum frame. Glass panel. De Vergennes uses a pry bar. Quiet. Professional. Ten seconds.

Inside: hallway. Stairs. Darkness.

They move upstairs. Third floor. They can hear the party. Music. Laughter. The sound of Malik's arrogance.

They reach the bedroom door.

Thomas doesn't knock.

He enters.

Malik stands at the window. Glass in hand. Looking at the lake. Completely unaware.

When he turns, Thomas's Glock is already pointed at his chest.

"Don't move," Thomas says. Quiet. Professional. No emotion.

Malik's hand drops. Glass shatters on hardwood.

"Who are—"

"Safe," Thomas says. "Where is it."

Malik's face goes pale.

150 kilos of fat and fear.

He points to the closet.

### 19:33 — The Bedroom Closet

The safe is large. Professional. Bolted to the floor. Modern lock. Combination.

De Vergennes sets up the thermite charges. Precise. Military. Thirty seconds to breach. Thirty seconds to cool.

"Open it," Leclerc says to Malik. Gun at his back. 9mm Glock. Suppressor. Business-like.

Malik's hands shake.

He tries the combination.

Fails.

Tries again.

Opens.

Inside: gold bars. Two dozen of them. Ten kilograms each. Yellow metal stacked like bricks.

Diamonds. Certified loose stones. Small leather pouches. More valuable than gold by weight.

US Treasury bearer bonds. Tens of millions. Untraceable. The ultimate currency.

Cash. Thousands. Fifty-pound notes. Euros. Dollars. One thousand franc notes.

Watches. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre. Dozens. Tens of thousands each.

And documents.

Papers. Folios. Bank account numbers. Names. Dates. Coordinates. Shell companies. Cayman Islands. Panama. Switzerland.

Everything.

The coordinates that lead to Hassan.

The bank accounts that lead to Yasmin.

The network they've been hunting.

Malik stands in his expensive bedroom surrounded by his stolen wealth.

A broken old man who bought safety with blood money.

Who thought Switzerland meant forever.

Who never understood that money is just paper.

And paper burns.

### 19:36 — Packing

They don't have time for the entire safe.

De Vergennes grabs the documents. Photographs them with a secure camera. Fast. Professional.

Tarkovsky and Leclerc load the gold bars into military duffel bags. Heavy. Practical.

The diamonds. Secured in a single leather case.

The bearer bonds. Folded carefully. Hidden in a messenger bag.

The watches. Wrapped and bagged.

Cash. Counted quickly. Two hundred thousand. Loaded.

Three minutes. Everything essential secured.

Thomas looks at Malik.

"Don't move for one hour," he says. "Call police after one hour. Not before."

Malik nods.

He understands the alternative.

### 19:39 — Dock Exit

They move downstairs.

The party still roars on the third floor.

Drunken laughter. Someone singing badly. Malik's guests completely unaware.

They exit through the dock.

Back to the lake.

Back to the shadows.

Back to the cars.

### 19:45 — En Route to Annemasse

Two rental cars. Black. Unmarked.

They drive north from Zug toward the French border.

Route to Annemasse: 272 kilometers. 3.5 hours drive time.

Zug → A4/E62 → A1 towards Lausanne/Geneva → border crossing (Bardonnex) → A41/D1201 to Annemasse.

The drive is silent.

No radio. No communication. No unnecessary movement.

Beaumont follows in a third car. Surveillance position. Watching for police.

They reach the highway. Swiss 3. Direction France.

Thomas drives. Tarkovsky in passenger seat. Leclerc and De Vergennes in back with the duffels.

The other car follows. Four more operators. Moreau driving. Two surveillance specialists in back.

Both cars keep distance. Professional spacing. Professional protocol.

### 23:15 — Approaching Border, Annemasse

The border at Annemasse is quiet at night.

Customs check. Passport control. Routine.

The lead car passes through first. French plates. French documents. French business people. Real identities. Real paperwork.

Customs waves them through.

The second car follows.

Same procedure.

Same legend.

They pass through.

They're in France.

They're out of Switzerland.

### 23:30 — Annemasse Safe House

A small apartment near the station. Rented weeks ago. Already prepared.

They unload the duffels.

The gold bars. Twenty-four of them. Laid on the table. Yellow metal. Beautiful. Deadly.

The diamonds. Six pouches. Small stones. Massive value.

The bearer bonds. Millions in untraceable currency.

The cash. Two hundred thousand.

The watches. Twenty-seven. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre.

The documents. Photographs. Bank accounts. Names. Coordinates.

Everything they need.

Everything they came for.

Thomas looks at the table.

"Secure the precious metals," he says. "The bonds go to Moreau. He'll move them through intermediaries. The cash stays here."

De Vergennes nods.

He begins securing the gold in a reinforced bag.

Military-grade waterproofing. Hidden compartments.

By midnight, everything is secured.

By midnight, the operation is complete.

Thomas steps outside.

Annemasse. French border town. Quiet street. Late night. Nothing moving.

He thinks about Malik.

Sitting in his expensive bedroom in Zug.

Watching the clock.

Waiting for permission to call police.

Understanding that his money bought him nothing.

That Switzerland is just geography.

That safety is an illusion.

By tomorrow morning, Malik will be questioned by Swiss authorities.

By tomorrow morning, the investigation will begin.

But by then, they'll be gone.

And the documents will have led them to Hassan.

And Hassan will lead them to Yasmin.

And Yasmin will lead them to the end.

Thomas looks at his watch. 00:30.

They've been gone from Zug for exactly 5 hours.

The operation was clean.

No casualties.

No police involvement.

Just blood money extracted.

Just documents secured.

Just one step closer to the hunt's end.

Inside, Leclerc makes coffee.

De Vergennes checks weapons.

Tarkovsky studies the documents.

Moreau monitors police frequencies.

No one speaks.

They know what comes next.

They know where the coordinates lead.

They know Yasmin is waiting.

And they know this is just the beginning of the end.
