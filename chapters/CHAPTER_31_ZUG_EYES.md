# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 31: ZUG EYES

Zug is quiet.

Rich quiet. The kind that means no one wants trouble.

Thomas gathers the team at 17:30. Floor plan of Seestrasse 47. Modern building. Three floors. Underground parking. Dock access on the south side.

"23:00 entry," Thomas says. "Malik will be hosting. Guests downstairs. Third floor is ours."

De Vergennes checks his tools. Pry bar. Crowbar. Bolt cutters. Manual. No explosives.

"Safe is bolted to the floor. We force it open. Twenty minutes maximum."

Beaumont monitors police frequencies from the van. Encrypted. Short range. No digital trail.

"Last patrol passed 22:00. Next cycle in fifty minutes. Window is tight."

### 22:30 — The Lake

They walk to the lake in darkness.

Night air. Water smell. Lights in windows. Rich people sleeping.

Thomas checks his watch. 22:55.

Tarkovsky. Leclerc. De Vergennes. Professionals. They understand the mission.

Beaumont whispers into the radio.

"Swiss patrol passing. You have forty minutes."

Thomas moves toward the dock.

### 23:00 — Seestrasse 47

They breach the dock door. Aluminum frame. De Vergennes uses the pry bar. Ten seconds.

Inside. Hallway. Stairs. Darkness.

They move upstairs. Third floor. Fast. Silent.

Music from below. Laughter. Malik's voice mixing with guests.

Thomas enters the bedroom. Malik at the window. Glass in hand. Looking at the lake.

When Malik turns, Thomas's Glock is already pointed at his chest.

"Don't move," Thomas says.

Malik's hand drops. Glass shatters on hardwood.

"Safe," Thomas says. "Where is it."

150 kilos of fat and fear.

Malik points to the closet.

### 23:02 — The Safe

Large. Professional. Bolted to the floor. Modern combination lock.

"Open it," Leclerc says. Gun at Malik's back.

Malik's hands shake.

He tries the combination.

Fails.

Tries again.

Opens.

Inside: gold bars. Twenty-four of them. Ten kilograms each.

Diamonds. Six pouches. Certified loose stones.

US Treasury bearer bonds. Tens of millions. Untraceable.

Cash. Two hundred thousand.

Watches. Twenty-seven. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre.

And documents. Papers. Folios. Bank account numbers. Names. Coordinates. Shell companies. Cayman Islands. Panama. Switzerland.

Everything.

The coordinates that lead to Hassan.

The network they've been hunting.

De Vergennes grabs the documents. Photographs them with a secure camera. Fast. Professional.

Tarkovsky and Leclerc load the gold bars into duffel bags. Gloves. No trace.

The diamonds. Single leather case.

The bearer bonds. Hidden in a messenger bag.

The watches. Wrapped and bagged.

Cash. Loaded.

Three minutes. Everything essential secured.

Thomas looks around the bedroom. Wipes surfaces. Window. Door handle. Anything touched.

De Vergennes does the same.

Tarkovsky does the same.

Leclerc does the same.

No fingerprints. No DNA. No trace that anyone was here except Malik's disrupted safe.

Thomas looks at Malik.

"Don't move for one hour," he says. "Call police after one hour. Not before."

Malik nods.

He understands the gun.

### 23:08 — Exit

They move downstairs.

The party is still loud on the second floor. Music. Voices. Completely oblivious.

Leclerc and Tarkovsky stop at the second floor. They enter the party room.

"No one leaves," Leclerc says. Gun visible. Quiet. Professional.

The girls understand. The guests understand.

Money and guns translate the same in every language.

They nod. They stay.

Thomas and De Vergennes exit through the dock.

De Vergennes wipes the door as they leave. Inside and outside. No fingerprints.

Back to the lake.

Back to the shadows.

Back to the cars.

Beaumont sees them exit. Silence is security.

### 23:15 — En Route to Annemasse

Two rental cars. Black. Unmarked.

They drive north from Zug toward the French border.

Route to Annemasse: 272 kilometers. 3.5 hours drive time.

Thomas drives. Tarkovsky in passenger seat. Leclerc and De Vergennes in back with the duffels.

The other car follows. Four operatives. Moreau driving.

Both cars keep distance. Professional spacing.

No speeding. No attention.

Just operators moving through geography.

### 02:45 — Annemasse Border

The border is quiet at 2:45 AM.

Customs check. Passport control. Routine.

The lead car passes through first. French plates. French documents. French business people. Real identities. Real paperwork.

Customs waves them through.

The second car follows.

Same procedure. Same legend.

They're in France.

They're out of Switzerland.

### 03:00 — Annemasse Safe House

Small apartment near the station. Prepared weeks ago.

They unload the duffels.

Gold bars laid on the table. Twenty-four. Yellow metal.

Diamonds in pouches.

Bearer bonds. Millions.

Cash. Two hundred thousand.

Watches. Twenty-seven.

Documents. Coordinates. Bank accounts. Names.

Everything.

Thomas looks at the table.

"Secure the precious metals," he says. "The bonds go to Moreau. The cash stays here."

De Vergennes nods.

He begins securing the gold in a reinforced bag. Military-grade waterproofing.

By 03:30, everything is secured.

By 03:30, the operation is complete.

Thomas steps outside.

Annemasse. French border town. Pre-dawn. Nothing moving.

Malik sits in Zug waiting for one hour to pass.

Swiss authorities will question him.

But it won't start with forensics.

It will start with Malik's bank records.

With witness testimony about the safe.

With financial trails leading to Hassan.

But by then, Thomas will already be hunting.
