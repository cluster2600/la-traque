# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 31: ZUG EYES

### 16:00 — Safe House, Zug

Zug is quiet.

Rich quiet. The kind of quiet that means no one wants trouble. The city sits on the lake. Mountains in the distance. Clean streets. Expensive cars. Not banks. Just money. Silent money. Sleeping money.

Switzerland. Where wealth doesn't announce itself.

Thomas arrives with the team in three Mercedes E-Class wagons. Five years old. Diesel engines. Practical. Professional. Invisible.

French plates. Real plates. Real identities created by the Bureau des Légendes. Everything traceable. Everything legal.

They park near the lake. Unload surveillance gear. Weapons cases. Safe house supplies. They look like French business people moving into temporary accommodations.

The safe house: three minutes from the lake. Near the casino. Where money moves quietly and wealthy men don't ask questions.

Apartment rented under Bureau cover. Consulting firm. French business operating in Switzerland. Paperwork perfect.

Switzerland doesn't ask questions when paperwork is correct.

When the legend is solid.

When everything is registered and taxed.

Beaumont and Richelieu take surveillance positions.

Tinted van. Parked across from Seestrasse 47. Cameras. Long lenses. Directional microphones.

They watch the door.

They watch the dock.

They wait for the target.

### 17:00 — Seestrasse 47

The building is modern. Glass and steel. Underground parking. Lake view. Expensive.

Malik is already home.

55 years old. 150 kilos. Fat man.

Thomas knows this from Abdelkrim. The financier. Fat. Lives in Switzerland. This is him.

Malik is preparing the house. Setting up for guests. But he will be alone when they arrive — mingling, playing host, unsuspecting.

### 17:30 — Safe House, Zug

Thomas gathers the team around the floor plan.

Seestrasse 47. Modern building. Three floors. Underground parking. Dock access on the south side.

"Beaumont and Richelieu watch the street," Thomas says. "Police scanner. You give us twenty minutes inside the house."

Beaumont nods.

"Four of us entry from the lake. Me. Tarkovsky. De Vergennes. Leclerc."

He points at the floor plan.

"Dock entrance. Ground floor. Stairs to the bedroom. Third floor. Safe is in the closet. We secure the target. We extract."

"Time limit?" Tarkovsky asks.

"Twenty minutes. In and out. Clean."

"Swiss police?" De Vergennes asks.

"We go in at 23:00. By then, guests will have arrived. Malik will be mingling, distracted, playing host. They won't hear anything on the third floor. Safe, quiet window."

De Vergennes checks his tools. Pry bar. Crowbar. Bolt cutters. Manual. No explosives. Nothing that leaves a trace.

"Safe is bolted to the floor," he says. "We force it open. Manual. Clean."

Moreau monitors police frequencies from the van.

Encrypted radios. Short range. No cellular. No digital trail.

Leclerc checks medical kit.

Tourniquets. Syringes. Morphine. Tape. Hemostatic gauze.

He doesn't expect to use it.

But professionals always prepare.

Tarkovsky checks his Glock.

Suppressor. Magazine. Slide. Chamber.

He doesn't think about morality.

He doesn't think about law.

He thinks about angles.

Lines of sight.

Who dies first if violence starts.

### 18:00 — Beaumont's Van, Seestrasse 47

Beaumont and Richelieu settle in.

Long lenses. Directional microphones. Police scanner on low.

They watch the door.

They watch the dock.

They watch Malik move through the house.

Lights. Television. Dinner. Wine.

A man living the life of a thief.

### 20:00 — Safe House, Zug

Thomas checks weapons one last time.

Glock. Suppressor. Magazine. Chamber.

Tarkovsky does the same.

De Vergennes has his thermite charges laid out. Six small devices. Enough to crack the safe. Not enough to level the building.

Leclerc has his medical kit ready. Just in case.

By 22:30, they're ready.

By 22:30, they're leaving the safe house.

### 22:30 — The Lake, Zug

They leave in two black rental cars.

Unmarked. Rental plates. No distinguishing marks.

They park a kilometer away. Side street. No cameras.

They walk to the lake.

Night air. Water smell. Boats rocking at docks. Lights in windows. Rich people sleeping.

Normal Swiss night.

Beautiful.

Peaceful.

About to be violated.

The dock is empty.

The house glows with light on the third floor.

Malik is still alone.

Still preparing.

Still thinking he's safe.

Thomas checks his watch. 22:55.

Five minutes until entry.

His team is in position.

Tarkovsky. Leclerc. De Vergennes.

Professionals.

Operators who understand the mission.

He nods once.

### 22:58 — Beaumont's Van

Beaumont whispers into the radio.

"Swiss patrol just passed. You have forty minutes."

Thomas doesn't answer.

He moves toward the dock.

Silent.

Purposeful.

Final.

### 23:00 — Seestrasse 47, Ground Floor

They breach the dock door. Aluminum frame. Glass panel. De Vergennes uses a pry bar. Quiet. Professional. Ten seconds.

Inside: hallway. Stairs. Darkness.

They move upstairs. Third floor. Fast. Silent.

Malik hears nothing.

They reach the bedroom door.

Thomas doesn't knock.

He enters.

Malik stands at the window. Glass in hand. Looking at the lake. Completely unaware.

When he turns, Thomas's Glock is already pointed at his chest.

"Don't move," Thomas says. Quiet. Professional. No emotion.

Malik's hand drops. Glass shatters on hardwood.

"Who are—"

"Safe," Thomas says. "Where is it."

Malik's face goes pale.

150 kilos of fat and fear.

He points to the closet.

### 23:02 — The Bedroom Closet

The safe is large. Professional. Bolted to the floor. Modern lock. Combination.

"Open it," Leclerc says to Malik. Gun at his back. 9mm Glock. Suppressor. Business-like.

Malik's hands shake.

He tries the combination.

Fails.

Tries again.

Opens.

De Vergennes is already there with the pry bar. He doesn't need it now. But he's ready if Malik won't open it.

Malik opens it.

He understands the gun.

Inside: gold bars. Two dozen of them. Ten kilograms each. Yellow metal stacked like bricks.

Diamonds. Certified loose stones. Small leather pouches. More valuable than gold by weight.

US Treasury bearer bonds. Tens of millions. Untraceable. The ultimate currency.

Cash. Thousands. Fifty-pound notes. Euros. Dollars. One thousand franc notes.

Watches. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre. Dozens. Tens of thousands each.

And documents.

Papers. Folios. Bank account numbers. Names. Dates. Coordinates. Shell companies. Cayman Islands. Panama. Switzerland.

Everything.

The coordinates that lead to Hassan.

The bank accounts that lead to Yasmin.

The network they've been hunting.

Malik stands in his expensive bedroom surrounded by his stolen wealth.

A broken old man who bought safety with blood money.

Who thought Switzerland meant forever.

Who never understood that money is just paper.

And paper burns.

### 23:05 — Packing

They don't have time for the entire safe.

De Vergennes grabs the documents. Photographs them with a secure camera. Fast. Professional. No fingerprints. He uses gloves.

Tarkovsky and Leclerc load the gold bars into military duffel bags. Heavy. Practical. Gloves. No trace.

The diamonds. Secured in a single leather case.

The bearer bonds. Folded carefully. Hidden in a messenger bag.

The watches. Wrapped and bagged.

Cash. Counted quickly. Two hundred thousand. Loaded.

Three minutes. Everything essential secured.

Thomas looks around the bedroom. Nothing left. No fingerprints. No hair. No DNA. No trace that anyone was here except Malik's own disrupted safe.

He wipes surfaces. Window. Door handle. Anything touched.

De Vergennes does the same.

Tarkovsky does the same.

Leclerc does the same.

Professional.

Thomas looks at Malik.

"Don't move for one hour," he says. "Call police after one hour. Not before."

Malik nods.

He understands the gun.

### 23:08 — Dock Exit

They move downstairs.

Fast. Silent. Professional.

The party guests are still laughing on the second floor. Music. Voices. Oblivious.

But they can't leave.

Not yet.

Not until the team is clear.

Tarkovsky and Leclerc enter the second-floor room with the guests. Glock in hand. Quiet. Professional.

"No one leaves," Leclerc says. "No one calls anyone. You stay here. You stay quiet. One hour. Then police. Not before."

The girls understand. The guests understand.

Money and guns translate the same in every language.

They nod.

They stay.

De Vergennes wipes the dock door as the team exits. Inside and outside. No fingerprints. No trace.

They exit through the dock.

Back to the lake.

Back to the shadows.

Back to the cars.

Beaumont sees them exit. He reports nothing. Silence is security.

No one saw them.

No cameras captured them.

No fingerprints.

No DNA.

No forensic evidence.

The guests are locked inside. They won't call police until Thomas's team is across the border.

Only Malik knows they were there.

And Malik will be found through his own bank records. His own financial network. His own witnesses who knew about the safe.

Not through anything they left behind.

### 23:15 — En Route to Annemasse

Two rental cars. Black. Unmarked.

They drive north from Zug toward the French border.

Route to Annemasse: 272 kilometers. 3.5 hours drive time.

Zug → A4/E62 → A1 towards Lausanne/Geneva → border crossing (Bardonnex) → A41/D1201 to Annemasse.

The drive is silent.

No radio. No communication. No unnecessary movement.

Beaumont follows in a third car. Surveillance position. Watching for police.

They reach the highway. Swiss 3. Direction France.

Thomas drives. Tarkovsky in passenger seat. Leclerc and De Vergennes in back with the duffels.

The other car follows. Four more operators. Moreau driving. Two surveillance specialists in back.

Both cars keep distance. Professional spacing. Professional protocol.

Motorway vignette already purchased. €40. Tax paid. Everything legal.

They drive through the Swiss night. No speeding. No attention.

Just professional operators moving through geography.

### 02:45 — Approaching Border, Annemasse

The border at Annemasse is quiet at 2:45 AM.

Customs check. Passport control. Routine.

The lead car passes through first. French plates. French documents. French business people. Real identities. Real paperwork.

Customs waves them through.

The second car follows.

Same procedure.

Same legend.

They pass through.

They're in France.

They're out of Switzerland.

### 03:00 — Annemasse Safe House

A small apartment near the station. Rented weeks ago. Already prepared.

They unload the duffels.

The gold bars. Twenty-four of them. Laid on the table. Yellow metal. Beautiful. Deadly.

The diamonds. Six pouches. Small stones. Massive value.

The bearer bonds. Millions in untraceable currency.

The cash. Two hundred thousand.

The watches. Twenty-seven. Rolex. Patek Philippe. Jaeger-LeCoultre.

The documents. Photographs. Bank accounts. Names. Coordinates.

Everything they need.

Everything they came for.

Thomas looks at the table.

"Secure the precious metals," he says. "The bonds go to Moreau. He'll move them through intermediaries. The cash stays here."

De Vergennes nods.

He begins securing the gold in a reinforced bag.

Military-grade waterproofing. Hidden compartments.

By 03:30, everything is secured.

By 03:30, the operation is complete.

Thomas steps outside.

Annemasse. French border town. Quiet street. Pre-dawn. Nothing moving.

He thinks about Malik.

Sitting in his expensive bedroom in Zug.

Waiting.

Watching the clock.

Waiting for permission to call police.

Understanding that his money bought him nothing.

That Switzerland is just geography.

That safety is an illusion.

By morning, Malik will call police.

By morning, the investigation will begin.

But it won't start with forensics.

It will start with Malik's bank records.

With witness testimony about the safe.

With financial trails leading to Hassan.

With accounts in Cayman Islands.

With names in Panama companies.

The money always leaves a trail.

The money always reveals itself.

And when investigators follow the money, they'll find Hassan.

And when they find Hassan, they'll find Yasmin.

But by then, Thomas will already be there.

Already hunting.

Already closing the circle.

Thomas looks at his watch. 03:45.

They've been gone from Zug for 4 hours 30 minutes.

The operation was clean.

No casualties.

No police involvement.

Just blood money extracted.

Just documents secured.

Just one step closer to the hunt's end.

Inside, Leclerc makes coffee.

De Vergennes checks weapons.

Tarkovsky studies the documents.

Moreau monitors police frequencies.

No one speaks.

They know what comes next.

They know where the coordinates lead.

They know Yasmin is waiting.

And they know this is just the beginning of the end.
