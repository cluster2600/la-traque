# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 5: DGSE HEADQUARTERS

The briefing room is on the fourth floor. Valérie-André building. Brunoy. The table is long. Wood. The kind of table where decisions are made. The kind of table where people's lives are determined by people they'll never meet.

The Director sits at the head. Bruno Léger. Sixty-two years old. Former field agent. Now administrator. He understands what's happening. He understands what will happen next.

To his right is the Deputy Director. Intelligence Operations. To the left is the Minister's representative. Young. Political. Nervous.

Across from them are the team leads. Counter-terrorism. Middle East division. Russia and Caucasus division. Financial crimes. Technical analysis.

Thomas enters. Everyone's attention shifts to him.

"Dieudegard," the Director says. "The floor is yours."

Thomas doesn't use slides. Doesn't use PowerPoint. He just talks. He stands at the end of the table.

"We have a cell. Minimum four people. Maximum seven. The speaker identifies himself as Yasmin Boudjellal. Algerian. Based on accent and dialect analysis, he's from northern Algeria. Possibly from Algiers. He's the ideologue. He's the voice. He's calling for France to apologize for Algerian colonization.

"Two bombs were placed in Métro Line 14. Two detonated. The third was supposed to detonate but didn't. Technical analysis shows the third device had a faulty timer. It was a luck event. Not planning. Not mercy. Just mechanical failure.

"The cell has a political agenda. They want France to apologize for Algerian colonization. They'll escalate. They'll place more bombs. They'll target crowded areas. They'll keep escalating until we stop them or until France makes a public apology."

"France won't apologize," the Minister's representative says. "That's not on the table."

"Then we stop them," Thomas says.

"How?" the Counter-terrorism lead asks.

"Financial traces. Travel records. Communications. The speaker said 'more will follow.' That means planning. That means logistics. That means money. Money leaves traces. Travel leaves traces. Communications leave traces."

The North Africa lead speaks up. "We have contacts in Algeria. We have sources in the Algerian diaspora in France. If this cell has Algerian elements, we can track them."

"Do it," the Director says.

"The technical team can monitor all known GIA sympathizer channels and political activist networks," the technical analysis lead says. "If they're planning the next attack, they'll communicate. We can listen."

"Do it," the Director says.

"Financial crimes will flag any suspicious transactions to known cell members. We've already identified the speaker as Yasmin Boudjellal. Algerian national. Wanted in connection with political violence in the 1990s."

"Do it," the Director says.

He looks at Thomas.

"You're the lead. Full authority. Full resources. What do you need?"

Thomas thinks about this. He's thinking about the cell. He's thinking about who places bombs in Paris. He's thinking about ideology. He's thinking about Jérôme. He's thinking about the thirty-minute delay.

"I need to understand the target selection," Thomas says. "Why Métro 14? Why between Châtelet and Saint-Lazare? Why that specific location?"

"It's a crowded line," Counter-terrorism suggests. "High volume of civilians."

"But it's not the most crowded," Thomas says. "Line 1 runs parallel. Line 8 is worse. Why 14?"

Nobody has an answer.

"There's a reason. There's always a reason. It's either logistical or it's personal. Either the cell has easy access to that line or that line means something to them. I need to know which."

He looks at the Russia and Caucasus lead.

"I need profiles on every known Chechen-Russian cell operating in Europe. I need travel patterns. I need financial flows. I need anyone with explosives training. I need anyone with Paris connections."

"We'll have preliminary reports by tomorrow," the lead says.

"I need them by tonight."

The lead nods. He understands this is no longer a request.

Thomas continues.

"I want surveillance on all known sympathizer networks. Not just ISIS. Not just GIA. Anyone with anti-colonial ideology. Anyone with French targets. I want to know what they're saying. I want to know what they're planning."

"That's a very wide net," the technical lead says.

"Cast it," Thomas says.

The Director is very still. He's watching Thomas. Watching how he moves. Watching how he commands.

"One more thing," Thomas says. "I want to meet with the survivors from this morning. The ones who were trapped in the middle car. I want to hear if they saw anything. If they noticed anything. If the attack was random or targeted."

"That's unusual," the Counter-terrorism lead says.

"Everything about this is unusual," Thomas says. "The target. The timing. The political demand. The faulty third device. The specific message to France about Algeria. This isn't random. This is calculated. Someone had a reason to choose that time. That place. That method."

The Director stands.

"Dieudegard is in charge. You all report to him. Whatever he needs, he gets. If he asks for resources you think he doesn't need, you give them to him anyway. Is that clear?"

Everyone nods.

"The Minister will be briefed hourly. The President will be briefed twice daily. We have a window before the next attack. Maybe days. Maybe hours. We use that window. We find this cell. We stop them before Paris burns."

The briefing ends.

---

Thomas is in his temporary office. A desk. A chair. A phone. A computer with secure connection. This is where he'll spend the next seventy-two hours. Maybe longer. Maybe until he finds them.

Moreau enters.

"The third bomb was real," Moreau says. "Technical analysis confirms it. It was supposed to detonate. The timer failed at 6:09 AM. Seven minutes after detonation of the second device."

"Lucky," Thomas says.

"Very lucky."

"That luck ends when they place the fourth bomb," Thomas says. "That one won't have a faulty timer."

"You think they'll place another?"

"I know they will. They said they would."

Thomas opens his secure email. Reports are already coming in. Financial analysis. Travel records. Communications intercepts. The machine is moving.

He reads through it all. Data. Names. Connections. Patterns emerging from chaos.

One name appears three times in the financial records. Someone who moved money to a safe house in the 11th arrondissement. Someone with connections to Algerian diaspora communities in Paris. Someone who traveled from Algiers to Paris four weeks ago.

Malik Benhadj.

Algerian. Age forty-one. Operations specialist. Explosives training. The name means nothing to Thomas yet. But it will.

Thomas makes a note.

"Get me everything on this person," he tells Moreau. "Everything. Birth records. Travel history. Financial history. Associates. Family. Where he sleeps. Where he eats. I want his entire life on my desk by morning."

Moreau nods and leaves.

Thomas sits alone in the office. The Paris streets are visible from the window. The city is quiet. Quiet and waiting. Waiting for the next bomb. Waiting for the next attack. Waiting to see if Thomas can stop it.

He thinks about Jérôme. He thinks about the thirty-minute delay. He thinks about the faulty timer on the third bomb. He thinks about luck and chance and how they determine who lives and who dies.

He opens his notebook.

He writes: "Find the cell. Stop them. Before the next delay becomes the next death."

He underlines it twice.

- Thomas's order: Find why Métro 14 specifically
- Thomas meets with survivors for eyewitness testimony
- First name emerges from financial analysis: Marko Sladović (Serbian, operations specialist)
- Thomas establishes temporary office, begins hunt
- Thematic: luck determining life/death (Jérôme, third bomb, Thomas's delays)

**Word count:** ~1,800 words (7 pages)
**Style:** Lee Child — dialogue, decision-making, tactical thinking
**Tone:** Shifts from action to investigation/command phase
**Narrative structure:** Meeting → analysis → first suspect identification

**Key plot elements:**
- Marko Sladović identified (operations specialist)
- Métro 14 target significance unknown (important thread to follow)
- Third bomb faulty timer (randomness/luck theme)
- Cell will escalate (ticking clock continues)
- Thomas takes full command of investigation

**Next chapter likely:** Either Thomas interviewing survivors OR surveillance/investigation of Marko Sladović
