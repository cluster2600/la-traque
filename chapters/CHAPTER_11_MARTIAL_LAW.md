# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 11: MARTIAL LAW

By midnight, France is under martial law. The President declares it on national television. No gatherings. No movement after 8 PM. Checkpoints at every border. Military in the streets. Tanks rolling through Paris.

The suburbs are celebrating.

In Mantes-la-Jolie, in the HLMs where Yasmine grew up, people are dancing. Singing. Screaming victory from rooftops. Two thousand, three hundred and ninety-one French dead. Nearly twenty-four hundred mothers without sons. Nearly twenty-four hundred children without fathers.

Algeria is avenged.

The police don't move. The military doesn't move. Not yet. The orders haven't come to crack down. Or maybe the orders came but the police themselves are uncertain. How do you order someone to shoot at their own people? How do you order someone to suppress celebrations for a victory that feels, in some way, like their own?

In Clichy, in Saint-Denis, in Villepinte, in every suburb where Algerian diaspora lives, the word spreads: Yasmine did it. Yasmine is still alive. Yasmine is coming back.

Yasmine is winning.

The government is reeling. The President is in a bunker. The military is mobilizing but without clear enemy. How do you fight a cell? How do you fight an ideology? How do you stop people who believe they're right?

In a safe house in the 19th arrondissement, the remaining cell members are gathering.

Malik Benhadj is there. Operations specialist. The one who built the Iveco trucks. The one who calculated charges and timing. His hands are shaking. Not from fear. From exhaustion. From adrenaline. From knowing what's next.

Hassan Medjahed is not there. He's in custody. In a DGSE holding facility. Being interrogated. But Hassan won't talk. Hassan believes in the cause. Hassan will die before he betrays Yasmine.

Inès Benmansour is not there. She was captured by police during the evacuation. She's being held. Being interrogated. Staying silent.

But the core remains. Yasmine. Malik. Three others whose names are known only to each other.

Yasmine looks at them. She's different now. Not full of hate. Full of clarity. Her skin is pale. She hasn't slept in thirty-six hours. But her eyes are clear.

"The government will hunt us," she says. "They will hunt every Algerian in France. They will round up anyone they suspect. They will torture. They will kill. The French people will turn against us. The suburbs will become war zones."

"We leave," Malik says. "Tonight. Now. Before the checkpoints tighten."

"Different routes," Yasmine says. "We don't travel together. We don't use the same roads. We meet in Algiers. That's the plan. That's the only plan."

She pulls out a map. Paris to the coast. Coast to Mediterranean. Mediterranean to North Africa. Different paths radiating outward like spokes on a wheel.

"Malik goes east. Switzerland. Zug. He has contacts there. Money people. Finance specialists. He'll convert our assets. Move the cryptocurrency. Build a fortress. He stays. He doesn't flee. He builds."

Malik nods. He's surprised. But he understands. Someone needs to secure the money. Someone needs to ensure the network survives financially. If Yasmine is captured. If Hassan is captured. If everyone is captured. The money remains. The network persists.

"Switzerland," Malik says. "Zug."

"Zug," Yasmine confirms. "You build. You wait. You secure our future."

"Hassan Jr. goes through Switzerland. Lausanne. Then Italy. Then Sicily. Then boat to Tunisia, then overland to Algiers. Ten days."

Hassan Jr. — no relation to Hassan Medjahed in custody — nods. Thirty-two years old. Operational planner. He's been with the cell since the beginning. He'll make it.

"Amina goes west. Nantes. Then boat from Brittany to Ireland. Then from Ireland to Portugal. Then south to Algiers by merchant vessel. Three weeks."

The woman — her real name is Amina — nods. She knows the route. She's family. Cousin of someone in the network. She'll make it.

"And you?" Malik asks.

Yasmine smiles. Not a happy smile. A smile that says: I know where I'm going and I know I might not arrive.

"I go to Marseille. Not directly. Not immediately. Train to Lyon. Then Marseille by secondary route. I have contacts there. The harbor is chaos. Marseille is old. Marseille doesn't care about government crackdowns. I board a fishing boat. Direct to Algiers. Two days across the sea."

"Marseille," Malik says. "The contacts."

"The contacts," Yasmine confirms. "People who have smuggled before. People who don't ask questions. People who profit from crossing borders. That's where I go."

"Most dangerous?" Malik asks.

"Most crowded. Most chaotic. Most likely to disappear into." Yasmine looks at him. "The coastguard will be looking for organized boats. Fast boats. Professional operations. A fishing boat out of Marseille, leaving at night with the daily fleet? They won't see it. They won't look for it."

She folds the map.

"We leave in three hours. Different safe houses. Different safe houses. No communication. No contact. If one of us is caught, the others don't know where we went. If one of us is tortured, they can't give up the others."

Malik reaches for her. For a moment. Just a moment. His hand touches her arm.

"Will you make it?" he asks.

Yasmine doesn't answer. She just looks at him. And he understands: she doesn't know. Nobody knows. France is hunting. Algeria is waiting. And in between is the Mediterranean.

Outside the safe house, the sound of military trucks. Tanks rolling through Paris. The government mobilizing. The hunt beginning.

In the suburbs, people are still celebrating. Still singing. Still dancing. They don't know the cell is scattering. They don't know Yasmine is leaving. They just know that for one day, they won. For one day, Algeria answered back.

By dawn, the cell is gone.

Malik is on a train heading northeast, hidden in cargo, sleeping fitfully. Hassan Jr. is crossing the Swiss border in a truck driven by a sympathizer. Amina is on a boat off the Brittany coast, heading toward Ireland, papers hidden, face covered. Yasmine is in Lyon, waiting. First for darkness. Then for the train to Marseille. Then for the fishing boats.

Thomas is still in Paris. Still in the command center. Still reading reports. Still understanding, slowly, that the cell is gone. That they've escaped the initial dragnet. That France's victory is incomplete.

He accesses the intercepts. The communications analysis. The financial traces. Marseille appears twice. Once for a fishing boat rental. Once for a safe house that matches Yasmine's profile.

Marseille. Not Montpellier.

He picks up his phone. He calls Moreau.

"Get me a car," Thomas says. "I'm going south. Marseille. Not the coast. Marseille."

"You can't go alone," Moreau says.

"I can. And I will."

Thomas hangs up.

He walks out of the command center. Past the soldiers. Past the checkpoints. Past the tanks. He gets in the MV Agusta and he heads south toward Marseille.

By nightfall, he's on the road. By tomorrow morning, he'll be at Marseille's harbor. By tomorrow night, he might still be there. Because fishing boats leave at night. And if he misses Yasmine by a few hours, he'll miss her forever.

The hunt narrows. The target becomes clear. Marseille is where she'll be. Marseille is where he'll find her.
