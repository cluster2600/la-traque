# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 11: MARTIAL LAW

By midnight, France is under martial law. The President declares it on national television. No gatherings. No movement after 8 PM. Checkpoints at every border. Military in the streets. Tanks rolling through Paris.

The suburbs are celebrating.

In Mantes-la-Jolie, in the HLMs where Yasmine grew up, people are dancing. Singing. Screaming victory from rooftops. Three thousand French dead. Three thousand mothers without sons. Three thousand children without fathers.

Algeria is avenged.

The police don't move. The military doesn't move. Not yet. The orders haven't come to crack down. Or maybe the orders came but the police themselves are uncertain. How do you order someone to shoot at their own people? How do you order someone to suppress celebrations for a victory that feels, in some way, like their own?

In Clichy, in Saint-Denis, in Villepinte, in every suburb where Algerian diaspora lives, the word spreads: Yasmine did it. Yasmine is still alive. Yasmine is coming back.

Yasmine is winning.

The government is reeling. The President is in a bunker. The military is mobilizing but without clear enemy. How do you fight a cell? How do you fight an ideology? How do you stop people who believe they're right?

In a safe house in the 19th arrondissement, the remaining cell members are gathering.

Malik Benhadj is there. Operations specialist. The one who built the Iveco trucks. The one who calculated charges and timing. His hands are shaking. Not from fear. From exhaustion. From adrenaline. From knowing what's next.

Hassan Medjahed is not there. He's in custody. In a DGSE holding facility. Being interrogated. But Hassan won't talk. Hassan believes in the cause. Hassan will die before he betrays Yasmine.

Inès Benmansour is not there. She was wounded in the catacombs and recaptured by police. She's also being held. Also interrogated. Also staying silent.

But the core remains. Yasmine. Malik. Three others whose names are known only to each other.

Yasmine looks at them. She's different now. Not full of hate. Full of clarity. Her skin is pale. She hasn't slept in thirty-six hours. But her eyes are clear.

"The government will hunt us," she says. "They will hunt every Algerian in France. They will round up anyone they suspect. They will torture. They will kill. The French people will turn against us. The suburbs will become war zones."

"We leave," Malik says. "Tonight. Now. Before the checkpoints tighten."

"Different routes," Yasmine says. "We don't travel together. We don't use the same roads. We meet in Algiers. That's the plan. That's the only plan."

She pulls out a map. Paris to the coast. Coast to Mediterranean. Mediterranean to North Africa. Different paths radiating outward like spokes on a wheel.

"Malik goes to Marseille. Train to Valencia. Ship to Algiers. Seven days maximum."

Malik nods. He knows Marseille. He has contacts there.

"Hassan Jr. goes northeast. Belgium. Then Germany. Then Poland. Then boat from Baltic to Algeria through Libya. Takes longer. Safer. Two weeks."

Hassan Jr. — no relation to Hassan Medjahed in custody — nods. He's young. Twenty-one. Operations assistant. He's been with the cell since planning began. He'll make it.

"Inès's replacement goes through Switzerland. Lausanne. Then Italy. Then Sicily. Then boat to Tunisia, then overland to Algiers. Ten days."

The woman — her real name is Amina — nods. She knows the route. She's family. Cousin of someone in the network. She'll make it.

"And you?" Malik asks.

Yasmine smiles. Not a happy smile. A smile that says: I know where I'm going and I know I might not arrive.

"I go south. Straight to the coast. Montpellier. I have a boat waiting. I cross the Mediterranean directly. Two days. Algiers."

"Fastest route," Malik says.

"Most dangerous," Yasmine says. "But the coastguard will be looking for boats trying to leave. They won't look for one leaving immediately. They'll think we're staying hidden for days. Planning escape for later."

She folds the map.

"We leave in three hours. Different safe houses. Different safe houses. No communication. No contact. If one of us is caught, the others don't know where we went. If one of us is tortured, they can't give up the others."

Malik reaches for her. For a moment. Just a moment. His hand touches her arm.

"Will you make it?" he asks.

Yasmine doesn't answer. She just looks at him. And he understands: she doesn't know. Nobody knows. France is hunting. Algeria is waiting. And in between is the Mediterranean.

Outside the safe house, the sound of military trucks. Tanks rolling through Paris. The government mobilizing. The hunt beginning.

In the suburbs, people are still celebrating. Still singing. Still dancing. They don't know the cell is scattering. They don't know Yasmine is leaving. They just know that for one day, they won. For one day, Algeria answered back.

By dawn, the cell is gone.

Malik is on a train to Marseille, hidden in a cargo car, sleeping fitfully. Hassan Jr. is crossing the Belgian border in a truck driven by a sympathizer. Amina is in a car heading toward Switzerland, papers forged, face hidden. Yasmine is on the coast near Montpellier, waiting for the sun to set, waiting for the boat to arrive, waiting to cross the sea back to the place she's never been but whose rage lives in her blood.

Thomas is still in Paris. Still in the command center. Still reading reports. Still understanding, slowly, that the cell is gone. That they've escaped the initial dragnet. That France's victory is incomplete.

He picks up his phone. He calls Moreau.

"Get me a car," Thomas says. "I'm going south. I'm going to find her before she leaves the continent."

"You can't go alone," Moreau says.

"I can. And I will."

Thomas hangs up.

He walks out of the command center. Past the soldiers. Past the checkpoints. Past the tanks. He gets in the MV Agusta and he heads south toward Montpellier.

By nightfall, he's on the road. By tomorrow morning, he'll be at the coast. By tomorrow night, he'll be swimming in the Mediterranean.

But Yasmine will be gone. Crossing toward Africa. Crossing toward Algiers. Crossing toward the place where the hunt begins in earnest.
