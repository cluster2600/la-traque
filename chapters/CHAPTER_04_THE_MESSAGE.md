# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 4: THE MESSAGE

The call comes at 9:47 AM.

Thomas is in the command center. The rescue is still ongoing. Thirty-eight people out of forty-three. Three still trapped. Two dead in the tunnel. The engineers are working on the last extraction. The structural collapse hasn't happened yet. The time is holding.

Moreau takes the call. His face changes.

"What?" he says. "When?" He listens. Doesn't say anything for ten seconds. Then: "We're on our way."

He hangs up.

"France TV just received a package. Delivered by courier this morning. A DVD. They opened it. There's a video message from the bombers."

Thomas is already moving.

"What does it say?"

"They haven't watched it yet. They called us instead. They want official presence before they view it."

"We go now."

The drive to France TV headquarters is fast. Sirens screaming. Two police motorcycles in front. Two behind. Red lights cutting through morning traffic. Paris parts around them. Officers on radios clearing the way. A black Peugeot in the middle. Moreau driving. Thomas in the passenger seat. Eyes forward.

Twelve minutes. The sirens don't stop until they arrive.

The France TV building is concrete and glass. Modern. Built in the 2000s. The security is tight. Police at every entrance. News crews are already arriving. Officers with riot gear. The rumor spreads fast in Paris. The attack was hours ago. Now there's a message. Now there's proof of intent. Now there's an escort arriving with sirens.

The head of security meets them. Nervous. Over his head.

"The package arrived at 9 AM. Hand-delivered by courier. Plain envelope. A letter inside. And a DVD. We read the letter first. That's when we understood what we had. We didn't touch the DVD after that. It's still in the case. Sealed."

They go to a secure room. Editing suite. Professional equipment. A technician is there. Sweating. Young. This is his biggest day.

Moreau reads the letter first. His jaw tightens.

"It's a statement. Demands. They claim responsibility. Three bombs. Two detonated, one failed." He looks up. "There's more coming. They're naming demands."

"What demands?" Thomas asks.

"France apologize. For colonization. For Algeria. Or they keep bombing."

Thomas nods. Takes the letter. Reads. Single page. Typed. No signature. No watermark. No clue to origin except the words themselves.

"Play the DVD," Thomas says.

The technician inserts the disc. The screen goes black for three seconds. Then static. Then a face.

It's a man. Mid-thirties. Dark hair. Dark eyes. He's sitting in front of a black background. Nothing behind him. Nothing identifying. He's speaking French with a North African accent. Algerian. He's speaking slowly. Deliberately. Making sure every word is understood.

"My name is Yasmine Boudjellal. I speak for the dead. For the forgotten. For the mothers of Algeria who buried children in mass graves while France pretended it was not genocide.

"Today, France felt pain. Today, Paris fell into darkness. Some are trapped. Some are dead. We do not know the exact numbers. But France will know soon. France will count the bodies. France will learn to count.

"This is the beginning. This is the message. France colonized Algeria. France murdered. France tortured. France erased a nation. France took everything and left corpses. Hundreds of thousands of corpses.

"France has never apologized. France has never said 'we were wrong.' France has never said 'sorry for the children. Sorry for the blood. Sorry for the mothers who lost everything in the tunnels of Algiers and the mountains of Kabylie.'

"We have sent a message. More will come. Soon. Very soon. More will follow until France says the words: 'We apologize for the colonization of Algeria. We apologize for the genocide. We apologize for the torture.'

"Only then will this stop. Only then will France know the darkness it created."

"This is not terrorism. This is justice. This is memory. This is the voice of the dead speaking through fire and blood.

"France, listen. France, apologize. Or France will burn."

The screen goes black.

The DVD ends.

Nobody moves for thirty seconds.

Moreau is very still. Thomas is very still. The technician is shaking.

"Play it again," Thomas says.

The video plays again. Thomas watches the speaker's eyes. His hand placement. His breathing. His certainty. This is a man who believes what he's saying. This is a man who will do what he's saying.

"Send this to all agency heads," Thomas says to Moreau. "And get me every frame analyzed. Speech patterns. Accent. Background analysis. I want everything."

"We need to alert the public," someone says. A government official. Nervous. Over his head like everyone else.

"No," Thomas says. "We don't. The public knows there was an attack. Let them think it's one attack. Let them think it's over. We don't distribute this message."

"But—"

"If we distribute it, you feed the narrative. You give them oxygen. You make them bigger than they are. We say nothing. We investigate quietly. We find them. Then we announce we've found them. No message. No broadcast. No platform."

Moreau nods. He understands.

"The third bomb," Thomas continues. "Where is it?"

"We don't know," the official says. "The message doesn't say."

Thomas already knows there's a third bomb. He doesn't need to be told. If there are two in the Métro, there's always a third somewhere. That's how cells work. You place multiple targets. You create multiple crises. You force the system to choose.

"Get me the video analysis," Thomas says. "Get me a profile. Get me everything."

He's already thinking about the cell. Four people minimum. Could be five. Could be seven. One is the speaker. One placed the bombs. One is the logistics. One is the money. One might be the planner.

The speaker has a Chechen accent. Possibly Chechen-Russian. Possibly Caucasus background. The ideology is anti-colonial. The target is French. The message mentions Algeria specifically.

This is political. This is personal. This is someone's war.

Thomas's war now.

"Where are you going?" Moreau asks.

"DGSE headquarters. I need to brief the Director. We have to mobilize resources now. Before they place the third bomb. Before they place the tenth."

The drive back is faster. Moreau knows the route. Knows the traffic. The building is in Brunoy. Forty kilometers south of Paris. Valérie-André building. The intelligence fortress.

Security. Credentials. Elevators. The Director's office is on the top floor. Glass overlooking trees. Very French. Very clean.

The Director is waiting. He's been briefed already. The DVD has been forwarded. The analysis is underway.

"Dieudegard," the Director says. "What do you need?"

"Full mobilization," Thomas says. "All available agents. All contacts in the Maghreb, Caucasus, Russia. I want financial records. I want travel records. I want names."

"We're already on it. The question is: what's your theory?"

Thomas sits. The Director sits.

"Four to seven person cell. At least one is Chechen-Russian based on accent. At least one has knowledge of Paris infrastructure. At least one has explosives training. At least one is handling ideology and messaging. At least one is funding. They've placed three bombs. Two detonated. One is still waiting. They have a political agenda: force France to apologize for Algerian colonization. They will escalate. They will keep escalating until they force a response."

"Or until we stop them," the Director says.

"Or until we stop them," Thomas agrees.

"You're in charge of the investigation. Full authority. Full resources. Find them before they place the third bomb."

Thomas nods.

He already knows where to start.

- Thomas doesn't participate in tunnel rescue (hands off to team, leaves for TV HQ)
- Views the video: speaker demands French apology for Algerian colonization

- Thomas's assessment: 4-7 person cell, Chechen-Russian element, political ideology
- Decision: suppress public distribution of message (don't feed narrative)
- Transition to DGSE headquarters for official briefing and resource mobilization
- Director gives Thomas full authority to investigate

**Word count:** ~1,700 words (6-7 pages)
**Style:** Lee Child maintained — dialogue-heavy, minimal description, focus on information and decision-making
**Tone:** Shifts from rescue action to intelligence/investigation phase

**Key intelligence elements established:**
- Political motivation (Algeria colonization apology)
- Cell structure (multiple roles)
- Escalation pattern (more attacks coming)
- Third bomb threat (ticking clock continues)

**Next chapter:** DGSE headquarters meeting with "the brass" — resource mobilization, team assignment, hunt begins
