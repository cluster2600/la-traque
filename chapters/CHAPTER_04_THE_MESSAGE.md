# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 4: THE MESSAGE

The call comes at 9:47 AM.

Thomas is in the command center. The rescue is still ongoing. Thirty-eight people out of forty-three. Three still trapped. Two dead in the tunnel. The engineers are working on the last extraction. The structural collapse hasn't happened yet. The time is holding.

Moreau takes the call. His face changes.

"What?" he says. "When?" He listens. Doesn't say anything for ten seconds. Then: "We're on our way."

He hangs up.

"France TV just received a package. Delivered by courier this morning. A DVD. They opened it. There's a video message from the bombers."

Thomas is already moving.

"What does it say?"

"They haven't watched it yet. They called us instead. They want official presence before they view it."

"We go now."

The drive to France TV headquarters is fast. Sirens screaming. Two police motorcycles in front. Two behind. Red lights cutting through morning traffic. Paris parts around them. Officers on radios clearing the way. A black Peugeot in the middle. Moreau driving. Thomas in the passenger seat. Eyes forward.

Twelve minutes. The sirens don't stop until they arrive.

The France TV building is concrete and glass. Modern. Built in the 2000s. Business as usual. Staff moving through hallways. Reporters on phones. Producers at desks. The day continuing like any other day.

Until Thomas arrives.

The sirens cut off. Police motorcycles pull to curb. Black Peugeot stops at main entrance. Uniformed officers step out. Moreau and Thomas move fast. Very fast. Not running. But moving with purpose. Moving with authority.

The lobby goes quiet. People stop. They watch. A government motorcade arriving at France TV building in the middle of a terror attack. No one says anything. Everyone understands.

The head of security meets them at the elevator. Nervous. Over his head.

"The package arrived at 9 AM. Hand-delivered by courier. Plain envelope. A letter inside. And a DVD. We read the letter first. That's when we understood what we had. We didn't touch the DVD after that. It's still in the case. Sealed."

They go to a secure room. Editing suite. Professional equipment. A technician is there. Sweating. Young. This is his biggest day.

Moreau reads the letter first. His jaw tightens.

"It's a statement. Demands. They claim responsibility. This is the message they're sending." He looks up. "There's more coming. They're naming demands."

"What demands?" Thomas asks.

"France apologize. For colonization. For Algeria. Or they keep bombing."

Thomas nods. Takes the letter. Reads. Single page. Typed. No signature. No watermark. No visible clue to origin except the words themselves.

The letter will go to DGSE labs. Analysis later. Printer forensics. Ink analysis. Paper source. Everything examined in a clean room with proper equipment.

Not here. Not now.

"Play the DVD," Thomas says.

The technician inserts the disc. The screen goes black for three seconds. Then static. Then a face.

It's a woman. Twenty-two years old. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Rage in her face. She's sitting in front of a black background. Nothing behind her. Nothing identifying. She's speaking French with a suburban accent. Parisian suburbs. She's speaking slowly. Deliberately. Fury in every word.

"I am the voice of those who have no voice. I speak for the dead. For the forgotten. For the mothers of Algeria who buried children in mass graves while France pretended it was not genocide.

"Today, France felt pain. Today, Paris fell into darkness. Some are trapped. Some are dead. We do not know the exact numbers. But France will know soon. France will count the bodies. France will learn to count.

"This is the beginning. This is the message. France colonized Algeria. France murdered. France tortured. France erased a nation. France took everything and left corpses. Hundreds of thousands of corpses.

"France has never apologized. France has never said 'we were wrong.' France has never said 'sorry for the children. Sorry for the blood. Sorry for the mothers who lost everything in the tunnels of Algiers and the mountains of Kabylie.'

"We have sent this message. More will come. Soon. Very soon. More will follow until France says the words: 'We apologize for the colonization of Algeria. We apologize for the genocide. We apologize for the torture.'

"Only then will this stop. Only then will France know the darkness it created."

"This is not terrorism. This is justice. This is memory. This is the voice of the dead speaking through fire and blood.

"France, listen. France, apologize. Or France will burn."

The screen goes black.

The DVD ends.

Nobody moves for thirty seconds.

Moreau is very still. Thomas is very still. The technician is shaking.

"Play it again," Thomas says.

The video plays again. Thomas watches the speaker's eyes. Her hand placement. Her breathing. Her certainty. This is a woman who believes what she's saying. This is a woman who will do what she's saying.

The ground shakes.

Not a small tremor. A full violent shake. The editing suite lurches. Equipment falls. Monitors crash. The technician stumbles backward. His chair slides across the floor and hits the wall. The building groans. Windows rattle. The tremor lasts six seconds. Then it stops.

But the sound doesn't stop.

The sound is everywhere. A roar. A pressure wave traveling through the air and through the building. The remaining windows in the editing suite explode inward. Glass shards spray across the room. People cover their faces. Blood on someone's neck.

"What was that?" Moreau says.

Nobody moves. Everyone is standing frozen, covered in glass dust. The building settles. The sound fades.

Then the sirens start. All across Paris. Every siren at once. Wailing. Screaming. The sound of a city in crisis.

"Get me confirmation," Thomas says immediately.

An aide runs to the monitors. Scrambles through the equipment. Finds a working screen. News feeds. Breaking news banner.

"Three explosions," the aide says. "The Louvre. The Élysée Palace. The Eiffel Tower. All simultaneously. Forty-five seconds ago. And—"

The aide stops. Looks closer at the screen.

"The Eiffel Tower. It's... it's collapsing. Into the Seine. The entire structure is going down. And all the windows across Paris. Every window. The pressure wave shattered every window in a three-kilometer radius. The city is—"

The aide doesn't finish. Nobody needs him to finish. They all understand.

Paris is under attack. Not one location. Four locations. Not one blast. Four massive blasts. Coordinated. Simultaneous. Professional.

The Eiffel Tower is in the river.

Thomas is already moving.

"Send this to all agency heads," Thomas says to Moreau. "And get me every frame analyzed. Speech patterns. Accent. Background analysis. I want everything."

"We need to alert the public," someone says. A government official. Nervous. Over his head like everyone else.

"No," Thomas says. "We don't. The public knows there was an attack. Let them think it's one attack. Let them think it's over. We don't distribute this message."

"But—"

"If we distribute it, you feed the narrative. You give them oxygen. You make them bigger than they are. We say nothing. We investigate quietly. We find them. Then we announce we've found them. No message. No broadcast. No platform."

The official looks uncomfortable.

"The director of France TV wants to broadcast a special report. Tonight. 8 PM. He's saying the public deserves to know."

Thomas doesn't argue. He already knows the outcome.

"Let him broadcast. Make a copy. Distribute it however he wants. By tonight, this video will be everywhere anyway. Better to control it than fight it. But understand what you're doing: you're giving her a platform. You're making her famous. You're spreading her message to every television in France."

Moreau nods. He understands.

"Get me the video analysis," Thomas says. "Get me a profile. Get me everything."

He's already thinking about the cell. Four people minimum. Could be five. Could be seven. One is the speaker. One placed the bombs. One is the logistics. One is the money. One might be the planner.

The speaker has a suburban French accent. Parisian suburbs. French-born Algerian identity. The ideology is anti-colonial. The target is French. The message mentions Algeria specifically.

This is political. This is personal. This is someone's war.

Thomas's war now.

"Where are you going?" Moreau asks.

"DGSE headquarters. I need to brief the Director. We have to mobilize resources now."

The drive back is faster. Moreau knows the route. Knows the traffic. The building is in Brunoy. Forty kilometers south of Paris. Valérie-André building. The intelligence fortress.

Security. Credentials. Elevators. The Director's office is on the top floor. Glass overlooking trees. Very French. Very clean.

The Director is waiting. He's been briefed already. The DVD has been forwarded. The analysis is underway.

"Dieudegard," the Director says. "What do you need?"

"Full mobilization," Thomas says. "All available agents. All contacts in the Maghreb. I want financial records. I want travel records. I want names."

"We're already on it. The question is: what's your theory?"

Thomas sits. The Director sits.

"Four to seven person cell. All members appear Algerian heritage. All speak French (suburban accent, not North African). At least one has knowledge of Paris infrastructure. At least one has explosives training. At least one is handling ideology and messaging. At least one is funding. They've placed bombs in Métro 14. At least two detonated. They have a political agenda: force France to apologize for Algerian colonization. They will escalate. They will keep escalating until they force a response."

"Or until we stop them," the Director says.

"Or until we stop them," Thomas agrees.

"You're in charge of the investigation. Full authority. Full resources. Find them before they place the third bomb."

Thomas nods.

He already knows where to start.
