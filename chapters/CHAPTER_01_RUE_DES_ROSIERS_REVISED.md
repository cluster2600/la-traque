# LA TRAQUE DE L'ATTENTAT DU MÉTRO 14
## CHAPTER 1: RUE DES ROSIERS (REVISED)

The MV Agusta Brutale is parked in the courtyard. Four cylinders. Dark metal. Italian precision. Thomas walks past it every morning. Every morning he thinks about riding. Every morning he rides.

5:47 AM. The alarm doesn't wake him. He's been awake for twenty minutes. The ceiling is white. The radiator ticks. Paris is still sleeping.

He gets out of bed. Cold floor. Bare feet. The apartment is small. One bedroom. Living room. Kitchen. Bathroom. Everything minimal. Everything necessary. Nothing excess. The walls are old. The wood is old. The building is old. Built in 1847. He knows this. He knows everything about the place he lives.

The La Marzocco has already warmed. The machine wakes before he does. It's programmed that way. He programmed it that way. Precision. Order. The espresso pulls dark and thick. No sugar. No milk. Just the coffee. Black. Bitter. Real.

He stands at the window with the cup and watches the street below. Rue des Rosiers. The Marais. Empty at this hour. A man walking a dog. A cyclist. The city waking up slow. Somewhere a siren. Probably ambulance. Probably nothing. Probably routine.

The phone rings at 6:12 AM.

Not his personal phone. His work phone. The encrypted one. The one that only rings when something is wrong.

"Dieudegard."

"It's Moreau. We have a situation."

Thomas doesn't ask questions yet. He waits. This is how it works. Moreau talks. Thomas listens. Then Thomas moves.

"Métro Line 14. Multiple explosions reported. Two confirmed detonations. Two separate train cars. Central station area. First reports came in three minutes ago."

Thomas sets down the espresso. It steams on the table. Untouched.

"How many casualties?"

"Unknown. Early estimates. The cars were packed. Morning commute. Heavy passenger load. Both cars are dark. No communication from either one. Emergency services are mobilizing."

"How many passengers?" Thomas asks.

"Estimates between one hundred fifty and three hundred per car."

Three hundred. Per car. Two cars.

"I'm moving. I'll be there in twelve minutes."

"We need you coordinating from the command center. Not on-site."

Thomas doesn't respond. He's already moving. He sets down the phone on speaker and walks to the bedroom. Opens the closet. Black tactical pants. Black shirt. Boots. The clothes he keeps ready. Always ready.

**FLASHBACK**

July 25, 1995. 4:45 PM.

Thomas is sixteen years old. He's at a café in the 5th arrondissement. With other friends from summer. A group of them had met at a colony de vacances. Summer camp. They'd promised to meet in Paris after the vacation ended. One last time together before life separated them.

Jérôme was supposed to be there. He was late. Very late. By 4:55 PM, he called Thomas's parents' apartment. Thomas answered. Jérôme's voice was rushed.

"I'm sorry. I'm late. My parents wanted to talk. Can we meet somewhere else? Somewhere closer?"

"Where?" Thomas asked.

"Saint-Michel. I'm calling from home. I can be there in ten minutes. At the Métro entrance. Okay?"

Thomas said okay.

Jérôme was sixteen. He was always late. He always apologized. He always had reasons. But he always showed up.

Thomas told the others. Said he'd go meet Jérôme. He'd catch up with them later. The others said fine. They stayed at the café.

Thomas walked to the Métro station. Not the Saint-Michel entrance. He got confused. Took a wrong turn. Lost five minutes. By the time he realized his mistake, he was at a different entrance. He decided to catch the next train. To go home. To call Jérôme and reschedule.

It was 5:10 PM.

He was buying a ticket when the sound came. Not loud. Not like you'd expect. Just a dull thump. Like something heavy had fallen. Then screaming. Then the announcement that there had been an accident. All passengers please exit the station.

The television was on in the station booth. Breaking news. An explosion. The RER B. Saint-Michel station. Multiple casualties.

Thomas didn't move for three minutes.

Then he called his parents.

They told him to stay put. They were coming to get him.

The phone lines jammed. The reports kept coming. Eight dead. One hundred fifty injured. No names yet. Bodies being removed from the wreckage.

Thomas sat in the station and waited.

Around midnight, a police officer approached him. Asking if he knew anyone on the train. Thomas said his friend was supposed to be there. Jérôme. He gave his name. The officer took notes.

The next morning, his parents brought him to the police station. They asked him to identify the body. But identification was complicated. The bomb had been under a strapontin. A fold-down seat. Jérôme had been sitting on it. The blast was direct. The body was difficult to identify visually.

They used dental records. Dental records took two days.

Two days of not knowing. Two days of hoping. Two days of the mathematics being impossible.

On day three, it was confirmed. Jérôme was dead. One of eight. Sitting on a strapontin. Waiting for Thomas. Who was lost. Who was confused. Who took a wrong turn.

If Thomas had been on time, would he have died too? Would they both have died? Would they have both lived?

The mathematics of death are impossible.

Thomas was sixteen when he learned that sometimes being late saves your life. Sometimes it kills your best friend. Sometimes there's no pattern. Sometimes it's just chance.

Twenty-three years later, he hasn't forgotten. He's still not sure if the delay was luck or curse.

Thomas is in the car now. Driving fast through empty Paris streets. The radio is on. The news keeps talking. Métro 14. Two explosions. Multiple trains. Hundreds of casualties. Numbers are climbing. The reports are fragmenting. Nobody knows how many are dead.

Thomas knows it's bad.

He arrives at the command center at 6:26 AM.

The chaos is organized but barely. Police. Fire brigade. Army liaisons. Medical personnel. Everyone trying to process what's happening.

Two bombs. Two train cars. Hundreds of people trapped in darkness. And Thomas has to find who did this and stop them before the third bomb detonates.

Because there's always a third bomb.

Always.
