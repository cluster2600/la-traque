# Coherence Fixes — Sprint 1

Fixed 4 critical character and plot contradictions identified during the full novel coherence audit (see `COHERENCE_REPORT.md`).

## C1 — Jérôme's relationship to Thomas (Chapter 8)

| | Value |
|---|---|
| **Before** | Thomas's "son" |
| **After** | Thomas's "holiday friend" |
| **Source of truth** | `TEAM_DOSSIER.md`, Chapter 18, Chapter 35 |

Jérôme is consistently described as a childhood/holiday friend across the rest of the novel. The "son" reference in Chapter 8 was an early error that contradicted three other sources.

## C3 — Casualty count (Chapter 11)

| | Value |
|---|---|
| **Before** | "Three thousand French dead" |
| **After** | "Two thousand, three hundred and ninety-one French dead" |
| **Source of truth** | `COHERENCE_REPORT.md` running total (documented: 2,391) |

The chapter-by-chapter running casualty total tracked in the coherence report reaches 2,391. The round "three thousand" figure was inconsistent with the accumulated count.

## C7 — Hassan Jr.'s age (Chapter 11)

| | Value |
|---|---|
| **Before** | "Twenty-one years old" |
| **After** | "Thirty-two years old" |
| **Source of truth** | Chapter 21, Beaumont surveillance notes |

Chapter 21 establishes Hassan Jr. as 32 years old in the Beaumont surveillance dossier. The two values cannot coexist in the timeline.

## C8 — Malik's age (Chapter 6)

| | Value |
|---|---|
| **Before** | "forty-one years old" |
| **After** | "fifty-five years old" |
| **Source of truth** | Chapter 32 physical description |

Chapter 32 explicitly states "55 ans, 150 kilos" in Malik's physical description. The Chapter 6 value of 41 is irreconcilable with this and with the character's established backstory.
